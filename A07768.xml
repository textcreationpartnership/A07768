            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Behold here their beginning, their progreſſion, their encreaſe, their ſecret, ſubtile, cruell, outragious enterpriſes, violences, aſſaults. A Myſterie (not without myſterie ſo called) vnder pretence of the miniſterie, ending in this prodigious eſtate that we ſee in this two-headed monſter; whileſt the miniſters of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, the Prelats, Biſhops, Archbiſhops, Patriarches, partly vnder Heathen Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> endured cruell perſecutions, partly vnder Chriſtians, though greatly enriched by them, whom they obeyed willingly, and in all humilitie at the firſt, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their deſires encreaſing with their meanes, more careleſly, and rather for a faſhion than otherwiſe; ſhortly after by open ambition, and flattering ſome in their ſinnes, eſpecially <hi>Phocas</hi> in his murder, they were made Vniuerſall Biſhops, and ſecular Princes in Italie, excluding Emperours; and not content to withdraw themſelues from their obedience, they likewiſe abſolued both the nobles and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of that oath of allegiance wherewith they were bound. At the laſt, threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with both ſwords, they mingled prophane things with holie, confounding
<pb facs="tcp:15502:5"/>
and deuouring the holie in the prophane. They ſet kings together by the eares,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that ſo they might ruin at one the other, and they by their ruine and ouerthrow riſe to the higheſt ſtep of their power. They crowne Emperours, make and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make them at their pleaſure, trampling them vnder their feet. They are now Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours and Popes together, the Lords and Monarches of the world, now higher than the Angels, equall with God himſelfe, nay gods, great and omnipotent, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogating and abrogating the commandements of the higheſt God, creating God himſelfe at their pleaſure, nay cauſing him to be created by thoſe whom they call their creatures. Now let him whoſoeuer he be that yet doubteth, couple &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare theſe two extreames together, A miniſter of God, ſometime a Prelat of the Church, now made a god, ſitting in his throne, vſing God (if we may beleeue it)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> as his officer: Sometime humble and gentle, yea the ſeruant of ſeruants, yeelding obedience to all Princes whatſoeuer, now proud, cruell, treading vpon the neckes of the greateſt powers, the greateſt Princes: Sometime glorious for the ſanctitie of his life, ſuffering ioyfully for the name of Chriſt all torments and tortures what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, now prophane, puffed vp with a vaine title of holineſſe, embrued &amp; made drunken with the bloud of Saints. What reaſon, what proportion can there be, I pray you, betwixt two extreames ſo different, ſo repugnant? And what ſhould ſtay vs but that with aſtoniſhment we may crie out, <hi>A Myſterie, great Babylon?</hi> In ſo ſtrange a noueltie, ſo diuers changes, is it poſſible that any man ſhould obiect the antiquitie of the Popedome; where Satan raigneth ſo viſibly vnder the onely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> name (to ſay no more) the maske of S. <hi>Peter?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let them not abuſe you with the name of the Church, the <hi>Catholike</hi> they call it, thereby inferring the <hi>Roman Church:</hi> For the Church of Rome is not, nor euer was, the Vniuerſall, the Catholike Church; a part thereof it was, ſo long as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued pure and vnpolluted: but yet but a part with others, not aboue others. And therefore by her fall, her ruine, the flock of Chriſt cannot periſh, though that periſh vtterly; by her defection the flocke of Chriſt cannot fayle, though that faile vtterly. True it is, that the Church of Rome was once pure and chaſt, and no ſmall part of the Spouſe of Chriſt, ſo long as ſhe hearkened to his voyce, and ſtopped her eares againſt the voyce of ſtrangers, hauing alwayes before her eyes her vow <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and contract of mariage: But the adulterer with falſe keyes crept into her bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, nay perhaps by her ſelfe was let in by the poſterne. Hee hath defiled her bed, and with that contagious copulation her beautifull countenance is become pale and gaſtly, her naturall colour defiled with paintings, her true doctrine infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with forged tales, in ſo much that in a manner ſhe is become nothing elſe but falſhood and lyes. Other Churches haue done their beſt endeuours to oppoſe themſelues againſt her, as that of Africa, France, Germanie, Greece, and other the Eaſt Churches. Neither were there wanting in her ſelfe faithfull dogs, who, with the danger of their liues, ceaſed not, ſo long as they might to barke at him when he began firſt to increaſe, to dig and to breake through the wall, oppoſing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> their defences, making head againſt him euen in the breach, vntill at the laſt by the colluſion of the Roman Clergie, hauing obtained the end of his deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ouerrunning all things at his owne pleaſure, he made the houſe of God (according to the prouerbe) the ſtable of <hi>Augia,</hi> the caue of <hi>Cacus,</hi> miſerably op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing all the godlie, yea pietie it ſelfe. From thence forward the ſuppreſſed gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the godlie brake forth, and the mournefull plaints of that <hi>woman that flew from the dragon,</hi> of our doue, the purer Church, were euery where heard. Her foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps ſometimes, though flying from the face of the perſecuters, you might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne,

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> but yet by the perſecuting rable vnmanured, defaced, halfe couered; Her voice amongſt the Salmonean thunders of the Popes was hardly heard, being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where interrupted by the noiſe of the ſparkling flames about her, and, as it were in Phalaris bull, in the writings of the Monks, and the mouthes of her aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries (leaſt we ſhould lament the tortures of the godlie) turned into the bellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an Oxe.</p>

            <p>But I will not deale ſo rigorouſly with you, will you know where, and what manner of Church ours was in all your time? Our Church was that Primitiue Apoſtolike Church inſpired with the holie Ghoſt, grounded vpon the word of God, which hath left vnto vs the Canon of the holie Scriptures the rule of our faith and life, the Symboll of the Apoſtles the badge of our Chriſtian warfare. To vs therefore that embrace all theſe, and to hold and defend them, reject all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inuentions, ſtoppe our eares againſt the voice of a ſtranger, the ſocietie of this Church, ſpread farre and wide through the world, and, as our Sauiour ſaith, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> continuing to the laſt day of the world, cannot be denied. But on the other ſide, againſt you is that curſe threatened by S.

Now tell me I pray, haue your traditions beene confirmed by theſe miracles? Can you or dare you affirme, that any of your mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres haue ſuffered for the Papacie, for the Popiſh doctrine, for the adoration of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, the worſhip of Saints, the traffike of Purgatorie, the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, Tranſubſtantiation? By what right then doe you arrogate vnto your ſelues the miracles and martyrdomes of that Church, by what right, nay rather what wrong, doe you take them from vs the true heires of their faith? I would to God, wee could as truely ſay of their conſtancie. Againe our Church is that, that hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:15502:6"/>
confuted and confounded <hi>Arius, Macedonius, Neſtorius, Eutiches, Pyrrhus,</hi> yea <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> himſelfe, who called into queſtion the diuinitie of the onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſonne of God, and of the holie ghoſt, and the two natures and two wils in one Chriſt. Ours are thoſe generall Councells of Nice, Conſtantinople, Epheſus, Chalcedon, and others; In which they with theirs were condemned and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne. Foraſmuch therefore as we approue and embrace all theſe, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Catholike Church repreſented in them, as we neuer wandred in any thing from their doctrine, ſo are we not to be ſeperated from their bodies. Tell me againe whether you dare to ſay as much; And if for ſhame you will ſeeme to dare, See ye not that your Pope is to be brought into order, that he is preſently to fall to the ground? Find you any where in any of thoſe approued and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> auncient Councells any place for thoſe your inuentions? And yet theſe bring vs to the ſix hundreth yeare after the natiuitie of our bleſſed Sauiour. In all which time, if thoſe points of doctrine which we affirme, are confirmed by the holie Scriptures, Symboles, Myracles, Martyres, decrees of Councels, and contrarily thoſe things we denie, doe no where appeare, nay are not ſo much as affirmed, may we not by good right and reaſon profeſſe that Church to be ours? And with better reaſon aske you, where your Church was for thoſe ſix hundred yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether? <hi>Vbinam Gentium?</hi> for to ſay the truth, <hi>there ſhee was, there ſhee fed;</hi> Not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hill of Sion, but the little hils and groues of Gariſim, the mountaines of Seyre, the paſtures of Paganiſme: From whence ye haue gathered, whatſoeuer,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> either the proud ſchoole of the Phariſies, brought into the Sinagogue, or the vaine ſuperſtition of the Greeke Philoſophers, into their Academy.</p>
            <p>From thence-forward the authoritie of one man by the contempt of the word of God, gathering ſtrength in the Church of Rome, the Princes likewiſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it was foretold, ſtriuing to giue their aſſiſtance, he made and vnmade lawes at his owne pleaſure, preferring humane inuentions before the diuine oracles, his decrees before the Canons of Councells, Nouelties before antiquities, things profane, before holie, borrowed from elſewhere before his owne, adulterat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lawfull, ſuperſtition before religion, and all this furniture of Paganiſme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſtian ſimplicitie, by which meanes the Church by degrees fell into this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> corruption, and languiſhing conſumption. In ſuch ſort neuertheleſſe, that in the middeſt of this corruption, this confuſion, a part of our ſelues did ſtill remaine, and that in a twofold manner. This Church was a part of our ſelues, though corrupt, cloked, and couered with wood and hay, and ſtubble, yea in a manner ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 3.</note> ſo long as ſhee ſtood vpon her onely true foundation Chriſt Ieſus, ſo long as the ſaluation of man depended vpon him onely, his merit, the bloud of his croſſe; Not vpon our owne or other mens workes, not vpon Popiſh abſolutions and indulgences, and other blaſphemous toyes of that nature. And as it falleth out, that the wind changing, the wether altereth, ſo for a time the matter hung in an equal ballance, vntill impietie ouer-weighing the mind of man, by a kind of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſelfe-loue, being prone to human inuentions, true pietie was taken away.

            <p>And theſe things fell out in the ſeuenth, eight, and ninth ages, in which the Eaſt Church was directly oppoſite againſt the Weſt, the Weſt at variance with it ſelfe, their Councells wauering, and in one and the ſame Councell voices di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, different opinions: we call theſe times the twilight of the Church, growing by little and little into an obſcure and darke night; A mooneleſſe night, wherein there are few ſtarres, and thoſe that twinckle moſt, for the moſt part wandring, not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> faſtened in the firmament the word of God. In ſuch ſort, that whither you reſpect doctrine or manners, this night ſeemed to be the laſt night of the Church, her breſt, yea her heart, being pierſt, and her throat cut; The doctrine of the onely me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, redeemer, ſauiour of mankind, Chriſt Ieſus, of his onely propitiatorie ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, almoſt extinct, and reſerued (if we looke into the outward face of things) amongſt a few.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> wherein that Dragon <hi>caſt out of his mouth water after the woman like a floud, that ſhee might be carried away of the floud.</hi> But ſhee whom thou ſeekeſt and perſecuteſt to the death, being got out of thy ſight, cutteth the ayre with her wings, ſeekes the ſteepie tops of the mountaines, where ſhee reſteth and hideth her ſelfe vnder the wings of the Almighty: And ſhee, whom thou like a wretch thinkeſt to be peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, in the beginning of the twelfth age, tooke her flight towards the plaine, God mouing and leading her the way, into Dauphin, Prouince, Languedock, Guyenne, the plains of Italie, filling all from the Pirenei hills to the Alpes, from the Alpes to the Appenine, with the preaching of the Goſpell.

But the eternall God, the true husbandman, doth not ſo, but humble and lowly as his vinyard is, the better to continue it in that humilitie, hee pruines it, and affoords now and then an eye vnto it, and that bedewed with tears, that it might yeeld the more and the better fruit; yea and ſometimes hee pluckes away the leaues, that it may lye more open to the beames of the Sunne, and ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the better, that when they come to the preſſe, they may yeeld a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent wine. And now thou knoweſt where our Church was in all this time.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> there was none ſuch, except thou ſeeke it among the Heathen with <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> not <hi>Simon Peter.</hi> In a whole thouſand yeares was there any Church that called the Hoaſt Lord, thought it a god, adored it? In a whole thouſand two hundred yeares, that ſhut it vp in a box, carried it about, appointed vnto it a proper feaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall day, ſet it out with pomp to be gazed vpon by the people, as in a publike The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre? Againe, in a whole thouſand yeares after Chriſt, was there any Church, howſoeuer otherwiſe corrupted, that placed Chriſt the ſonne of God betweene the hands of a Prieſt, yea created him, that ſold his ſacrifice for money, to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at all times, yea euerie moment of time, and in all places; That aboliſhed the auncient inſtitution of Chriſt, and Communion of the faithfull, bringing into the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> place thereof their ſolitarie Maſſes for the liuing and the dead, mumbled vp in a corner; That depriued the people of the Cup of the Lord, to feed them with the ſmoke of this pretended ſacrifice? And ſince I am entred into it, to lay open theſe monſtrous abuſes to the view of the world, Was there any Church that accuſed the Scriptures of inſufficiencie, or imperfection, writing bookes to that purpoſe; That forbad the reading of them, as being daungerous and deadly, vpon paine of grieuous puniſhment, and that by a publike Decree? Againe, was there any Church in the whole world, for ſix hundred yeares after Chriſt, that beleeued the Pope of Rome to be the Vniuerſall Biſhop, an earthlie Prince, armed with both ſwords ſpirituall and temporall; That for a thouſand yeres, out of Rome, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> him to be Pope and Emperour, the Lord of the world, the true Spouſe of the Church; That for twelue hundred yeares did affirme him to be aboue gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councels, the Catholike Church, the Scriptures; That did affirme or teach, That he had power to diſpoſe of the ſtate of our ſoules by his Indulgences, That he could ſhut Purgatorie, open heauen, canonize for a Saint, or damne to hell, at his pleaſure, whom it pleaſed him; commaund the Angels, abrogat the lawes of God, and therefore a god, and aboue God? Adde if you will, to make vp the matter, What Church in thoſe ages euer knew thoſe multitudes of Monkes, the foure Orders of begging Friers, the ſcarlet Cardinals, this Pontificall pompe, his Ianizaries and Mamalukes, and laſtly his Ieſuites, who are as it were the rereward <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of the Popes armie? And yet of theſe doth your Church now conſiſt, and they muſt be beleeued vpon paine of damnation. Herein <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Baronius</hi> ſpend their labours, and he that abates but a haire of that they affirme, let him bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as a Heathen or Publican. That man on the other ſide that beleeues all this, eſpecially all thoſe poynts that concerne the Pope, though he be otherwiſe an heretike, a prophane perſon, an Atheiſt, yet he is a good Catholike, and in the right way. It is now then your part to proue this your Church out of the Fathers, Councels, Hiſtories, yea euen your owne, for I refuſe not any.</p>
            <p>But perhaps thou wilt aske, though againſt the rules of diſputation, By what apparent reaſon it appeares that your Church hath erred, and how it ſhould bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> likely, that it hath hitherto receiued Chriſt his enemie for Chriſt his Vicar, and how and in what part that corruption thou ſpeakeſt of hath crept in? Hearken, my friend, let not this prepoſterous preſumption deceiue thee; the Angels in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen haue erred, our firſt parents in Paradice haue erred, <hi>Iacob</hi> amongſt ſo many vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of God, Iſrael in the deſart, in the middeſt of ſo many myracles, haue erred; the Church, the Spouſe of God, vnder the Iudges, the Kings in the preſence of the Arke, in that holie land, though reproued by the Prophets, verie often, in the time of the firſt Temple, and as often vnder the ſecond, and that which is more, puffed vp with the doctrine of the Law, euen to the forſaking of Chriſt himſelfe,
<pb facs="tcp:15502:8"/>
the crucifying of him with her owne hands, and conſequently in her owne ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> hath erred: What then ſhould hinder but that it may now likewiſe erre, euen to the receiuing of Antichriſt, <hi>that man of ſinne, the ſonne of perdition,</hi> and the adoring of him, ſince both the one and the other proceed from the ſame ſpirit of preſumption, not to erre; both the one and the other foretold by the ſame mouth, by the ſpirit of God in his word; and therefore of like certaintie? Doubtleſſe the Church then hath erred, erred by neglecting the word of God, and ſhall erre as often as ſhe ſhall forſake the ſea-mans compaſſe, without which all things are to it vncertaine, the heauens, the ſea, the earth: In ſo much that being left to her own diſcourſe, her owne cogitations, it is no maruell if ſhe haue erred, if ſhe doe erre: yea rather it were a wonder, and more than a wonder, if without that compaſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſhe ſhould hold her courſe but a moment of time, and not bee ſplit in peeces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome rocke, or ſuffer ſhipwracke vpon ſome vnknowne ſhore. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thou deſireſt to know the moment of time when this accident happened, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, my friend, that this Myſterie was wrought in the darke: for Antichriſt is compared to a theefe that digs through the wall in the dead time of the night. At what watch therefore he began his worke, it is your part to know, and to tell vs that ſtand ſentinell, that haue ſo long time before beene forewarned by God himſelfe, by whoſe either negligence or treacherie he hath inuaded the Roman ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and therefore your Church. But thou art perhaps ſicke of a dropſie, thy bellie is ſwolne as big as a tunne, thy bloud turned into water, and yet thou wilt not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> hearken to the Phyſitian, change the courſe of thy life, vntill he tell thee the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie inſtant time when thy liuer began to be diſtempered, to bee inflamed, to grow drie, and to be hardened into a Schyrrus; whereas thou ſhouldeſt haue beene the firſt that ſhould haue knowne that, if it might be, becauſe there is no man ſo neere vnto thee as thy ſelfe. There is nothing more ridiculous, than to thinke that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould know it before thy ſelfe, eſpecially conſidering it is one of thoſe diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, according to <hi>Hypocrates,</hi> that at the firſt is moſt hardly knowne, moſt eaſily cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, afterwards by tract of time the ſymptomes, or accidents belonging thereunto encreaſing, it is eaſily knowne, hardly cured.</p>
            <p>But yet I will not refuſe to ſatisfie thee herein, if I can. Thou wouldeſt know <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> when Antichriſt inuaded this chayre, which for a long time hee coueted, and now poſſeſſeth. It was neceſſarie that the <hi>Palladium, le Garde corps</hi> of the Church ſhould firſt be ſtollen, before he could be receiued, before that fatall horſe could be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; The word of God, the Candleſticke of the holie Scriptures muſt firſt bee hid vnder a buſhell, before the theefe durſt creepe in, or make any aſſault vpon the Church; which ſtill continuing in force, in vaine could that ſinke of ſuperſtitions beſiege it, but we kept it farre off from our Troy, our rampiers, our territories, much more from the porch, the Temple, the Sanctuarie of the Lord. That old Dragon, vnder the colour of <hi>a not written word,</hi> cunningly and cloſely brought in Traditions to betray the Church; which the wiſedome of the fleſh, their neere al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> better agreeing with carnall reaſon, did willingly and with good counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance receiue, equalled them with the Written word, the ſacred oracles, made them ſit cheeke by cheeke with them. This law of equalitie being often attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in the ſeuenth age, and ſeuenth Idolatrous Synod, it was eſtabliſhed, yea and by vertue thereof Traditions preferred before the Word, oppoſed againſt it. Then <hi>Simon,</hi> rather vnder the name than ſhape of <hi>Simon,</hi> began to appeare, by diuers cunning deuices couering his treacherie, perſuading vs to receiue that dangerous engine, that Troian horſe, that Epitome as it were of all the Painims impieties,

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> into the place of our Palladium, the word of God. <hi>Capis</hi> then and diuers others <hi>who were of a ſounder iudgement,</hi> fearing their ſubtilties, and finding them, cried out to haue it burnt. The moſt famous Fathers of the Church throughout the world, foretold, threatened the euill to come, reſiſted, banded themſelues againſt it.

            <p>From thence forward he put all to fire and ſword in the citie, ranſacked the Church, polluted the holie things, left nothing vntouched with the infectious hands of his Harpies, powred out of that fatall horſe all manner of ſuperſtitious ſeruices in the Church, calling this horſe (although a marke of the Greekes) the Troian horſe. Theſe ſuperſtitions, Catholike, Orthodoxall, becauſe conſecrated and hallowed (theſe are their owne words) by the Popes, though from their bgin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they were Heatheniſh and Idolatrous.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:15502:27"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> yet were there in all that time Biſhops of Rome: neither during that eclipſe of Chriſtian Emperours in the reigne of <hi>Iulian</hi> could anie Councell be aſſembled, how great ſoeuer the neceſſitie of the Church at that time was; and yet the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of Rome were at that time growne to ſome jolitie, and began to looke ſomewhat big vpon the matter, and to affect a ſoueraignetie ouer the Church of God: But be it <hi>Iulius</hi> aſſembled a Synod at Rome, at the requeſt as well of <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> as of the Euſebians, his Antagoniſts: what then? Was it to judge of the difference betweene them by way of Appeale, or was it rather to compoſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters betweene them as an indifferent friend?

Peter: let the matter be ſignified by letter to Iulius Biſhop of Rome, to the end that he, with other Biſhops of his dioces, may enter againe into the knowledge of the cauſe.</hi> And <hi>Balſamon</hi> vpon this place affirmeth, That the like priuiledge was graunted to the Biſhop of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople. But come we to the point: And firſt, it was <hi>Hoſius</hi> which propoſed it; and he propoſed it as a new and extraordinarie antidot againſt a poyſon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that the Biſhops of the Eaſt were for the greateſt part at that preſent infected with Arrianiſme: and his purpoſe was, that if anie found himſelfe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and aggrieued by the Arrians, he might by vertue of this Canon haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to Rome, and to the Biſhops of Italie, who continued at that time ſound in the Orthodox profeſſion, reſtraining it to the perſon of <hi>Iulius,</hi> and would no doubt haue done otherwiſe in the perſon of <hi>Liberius,</hi> ſucceſſor vnto <hi>Iulius,</hi> and a profeſſed Arrian, notwithſtanding that pretended chaire of S. <hi>Peter.</hi> And ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly note theſe words, <hi>If it pleaſe you, let vs honour the memorie of S. Peter:</hi> For had this beene an auncient right, ſhould he not rather haue ſaid, Let vs obſerue the commaundement of the Lord, or the auncient order of the Church, or the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the Nicene Councell, whereby it is ordained, That men might appeale to Rome? In ſtead whereof he ſpeaketh as of a new propoſall, extraordinarie and arbitrarie, at their pleaſures. Thirdly, is it reaſon, that a Canon of a Nationall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Councell ſhould conclude and bind the Church in generall? Or can <hi>Baronius</hi> reckon this for a Generall Councell, without ouerthrowing all Hiſtories, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting the whole order of the Councels, as they are alreadie placed? For if we number this for one, where then ſhall thoſe of Conſtantinople, of Epheſus, and of Chalcedon ſtand? Or becauſe <hi>Athanaſius</hi> calleth it a <hi>Great Councell,</hi> is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Generall one? Is not the firſt Councell of Arles called a <hi>Great</hi> one, becauſe there met in it the Biſhops of ſundrie Prouinces, which yet was neuer numbred among the Generall Councels? And doth not the Decrete it ſelfe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>D.</hi> 16. <hi>can.</hi> 10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11.</note> authorized by the Popes, ranke it with the Nationals? And to conclude, ſeeing that his reaſons
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:15502:29"/>
whereon he groundeth his aſſertion, namely, becauſe it was called by the Biſhop <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of Rome, and becauſe his Legats were there preſent, are found to be falſe, what credit can the aſſertion it ſelfe deſerue? Fourthly, this Canon ſo made vpon the preſent occaſion, was neuer practiſed, and was afterwards in expreſſe tearmes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked: Neither can it be denied, but that at that inſtant, and ſhortly after, there were manie Biſhops depoſed in the Eaſt Churches as well as before. But did euer anie claime the benefit of this Canon? Or is it likely that they would haue omitted ſuch a meane of their reſtitution, if anie ſuch had beene of force? And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked it was, as I haue ſaid, in expreſſe tearmes, namely, in the Councell of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, <hi>Can.</hi> 3. and in that of Chalcedon, <hi>Can.</hi> 28. both of them being Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels Generall, as <hi>Baronius</hi> himſelfe acknowledgeth, and both of them graunting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> equall priuiledges to the two Churches of Conſtantinople and of Rome, in all reſpects, ſauing alwaies to the Biſhop of Rome his precedencie: which could not haue beene, had the Eaſterne Churches beene alwaies tyed to anſwer to appeales at Rome; and we ſhall ſee hereafter how the Churches of Africa would neuer be drawne to yeeld thereunto. Whence it appeareth, that that Canon was neuer meant but onely in caſe of deſtitution or reſtitution of certaine Biſhops then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who were by this Canon ordered to referre their differences to the Biſhop of Rome, who was not tainted with Arrianiſme, as ſome of the Eaſterne Biſhops were.

                  <p>And this contagion ſpread it ſelfe ſo farre, that the Chriſtian Emperours, <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian, Valens,</hi> and <hi>Gratian,</hi> were faine to take order by expreſſe law againſt it: which law was directed and ſent to <hi>Damaſus;</hi>

The diſpoſition of the law is wiſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident, and yet is not our auarice reſtrained: Wee may not any longer admit of legacies in our owne perſons, therefore we take a courſe to circumuent the law, by procuring legacies and inheritances to be made ouer in trust to others, to our vſes: And as if the lawes of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour were greater than the lawes of Chriſt, we feare them, and neglect the precepts of the Goſpell.</hi> And much after this manner ſpeaketh alſo Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his thirteenth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Epiſtle.<note place="margin">Baron. vol. <hi>4.</hi> an. <hi>370.</hi> art. <hi>123.</hi>
                     </note> But <hi>Baronius</hi> would here perſuade vs, That the Emperours made this law at the motion of <hi>Damaſus</hi> himſelfe: as alſo, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> long before that time paſſed another Edict at the inſtance of Pope <hi>Syluester,</hi> and of the Biſhops; by which he inhibited the gentrie of the Empire to make themſelues of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie; becauſe that by reaſon of the large priuiledges and immunities belonging to that Order, the richer ſort put themſelues into the miniſtrie, and ſo left the Commonwealth vnſerued: And this he ſaith to no other end, but that Princes and States in theſe dayes ſhould not offer, by their examples, out of their owne regall authoritie, to order and reforme the Churches. But the truth is, that thoſe Emperours ordered and limited the juriſdiction of the Clergie (which euen in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> thoſe dayes began to encroach vpon the temporall Courts) by an expreſſe law and ordinance directed vnto them:<note place="margin">L. <hi>23.</hi> de E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſc. &amp; Cler. in Cod.

                     </note> that this they did onely in policie, to engage <hi>Theodoſius</hi> in the maintenance of their profeſſion: And what need, ſeeing the world taketh notice, that he was as zealous for religion, as was the beſt of them?

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:15502:35"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> That indeed <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> had now condemned in the Weſt what formerly had been condemned in the Eaſt: not that <hi>Theophilus</hi> had need of confirmation from him, for his ſentence was abſolute, and carried execution with it: But as <hi>Hieroſme</hi> ſaith, <hi>They both did it with the ſame zeale, as led by the ſame ſpirit, becauſe they had both drunke out of the ſame fountaine of the Scriptures.</hi>

                     </note> which equalleth Conſtantinople with Rome, how could <hi>Theophilus</hi> haue medled in this election; and thence concludeth, that it is a forged Canon, in deſpight of all Hiſtories whatſoeuer. But let this Annaliſt read the Hiſtorie once more: <hi>To giue the greater credit and luſtre to this election</hi> (ſayth <hi>Socrates) there were alſo manie other Biſhops there aſsembled by order from the Emperour, and among the reſt Theophilus of Alexandria, who did what he could to ſtaine the credit and reputation of Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome.</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Whence it appeareth, that he was not there but by ſpeciall order from the Emperor <hi>Arcadius;</hi> and therefore his argument concludeth not. And here began the quarrell betweene theſe two: <hi>Theophilus</hi> a man of an implacable ſpirit, tooke the other to taske; the reaſon was, for that <hi>Theophilus</hi> had not long before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated certaine Origeniſts, who preſently fled to <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> whom yet <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> would not receiue to his Communion, vntill he might heare the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of <hi>Theophilus,</hi> either by himſelfe, or by ſome others from him, concerning their excommunication: <hi>Theophilus</hi> alſo had this aduantage ouer him, that through his libertie of ſpeech in pulpit, he had drawne the hatred of the great ones of the Court, and of the Emperour himſelfe, but aboue all, of the Empreſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> vpon his head: Wherefore <hi>Theophilus</hi> was ſent for, to ſit vpon him; who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Conſtantinople, aſſembled a Synod, but for feare of the people held it without the citie; the Synod conſiſting for the moſt part of thoſe Biſhops whom <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> for their demerits had formerly depoſed.<note place="margin">Pallad. in vita Chryſoſt. an. <hi>403</hi>

vpon that third Canon of Conſtantinople, if anie ſuch had beene in force?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> I anſwere, becauſe the Canon of the Nicene Councell was more proper for his purpoſe, the queſtion not being properly of juriſdiction, but of the integritie of his perſon.

True it is, that in this ſecond conflict he tryed all his friends; whereupon <hi>Baronius</hi> is bold,<note place="margin">Baron. to. <hi>5.</hi> an. <hi>404.</hi> art. <hi>20.</hi> &amp; ſeq.</note> and ſayth, <hi>That he had recourſe by way of Appeale to the Church of Rome as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, which was onely able to correct all other Churches, and that he appealed to Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Biſhop of Rome in perſon.</hi> Which he reporteth with that confidence, as a man would thinke himſelfe almoſt bound in conſcience to beleeue him: adding far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, That all this fell out by the wonderful prouidence of God, to ſhew men how they ought vpon like occaſions to flie to the Pope of Rome. But let vs ſee what proofes: for our part we are content to ſtand to his owne allegations, and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to that Epiſtle of <hi>Chryſostome</hi> vnto <hi>Innocent:</hi> which Epiſtle, by his leaue, is not directed to <hi>Innocent</hi> alone, but jointly to all the Biſhops of the Weſt, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, in that the whole Epiſtle runneth in tearmes of the plurall number; neither in ſix whole pages, which that Epiſtle taketh vp, is the word of <hi>Appeale</hi> ſo much as once named: but we find there manie other things which make againſt them; as firſt, that he declareth vnto them the cauſe of his exile to haue beene onely, <hi>that he would haue appealed to a Councell,</hi> meaning a Generall Councell, as we ſaid before; and conſequently not to the Biſhop of Rome. Secondly, that he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their charitie <hi>to awake, and to helpe to put ſome end to theſe his miſeries,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not their pretended omnipotencie. Thirdly, <hi>I humbly beſeech you</hi> (ſayth he)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> 
                     <hi>my moſt reuerend Lords, to preuent this ruine;</hi> and therefore not <hi>Innocent,</hi> or his See alone: and what ruine was it? <hi>For if</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this cuſtome take place, and it may be lawfull for one to enterpriſe vpon anothers Prouince, all is loſt.</hi> His meaning was, that they ſhould helpe to order this matter by a Councell, in execution of that Canon of Nice, and therefore he entreateth them <hi>to retract and to diſannull all that which had beene practiſed or attempted againſt him:</hi> ſo farre was he from requeſting <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,</hi> who dwelt farther off than the other, to interpoſe his authoritie in the cauſe. Fourthly, in that he telleth them, <hi>That he had written the ſame things to Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerius Biſhop of Milan, and to Chromatius Biſhop of Aquileia:</hi> and ſo indeed had he alſo written to <hi>Aurelius</hi> Biſhop of Carthage. By which appeareth, that he wrote <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to ſundrie other Biſhops which then were of eſteeme and authoritie in the Church, as well as to <hi>Innocentius;</hi> whom he could not omit, in regard that he was Biſhop of the firſt See: but he <hi>appealed</hi> not to one more than to another. The like alſo may appeare by the reſolution which <hi>Innocentius</hi> tooke in this buſineſſe: for hauing receiued the letters, and heard the embaſſages of both parties, in good diſcretion he admitted them both to his Communion, thereby declaring, that the ſentence which was giuen againſt <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> was vnjuſt:<note place="margin">Theodor.

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> where neither oppoſites nor partiſans of either of them ſhould be preſent, and there giue iudgement according to the Canons of Nice:</hi> which was nothing elſe in effect, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to giue way to the Appeale, which <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> had from the beginning put in, to a Generall Councell: which he requeſted <hi>Innocentius</hi> and others, according to the practiſe of the Church in thoſe times, to procure from the Emperors <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius;</hi> eſpecially from <hi>Arcadius,</hi> who being offended with <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> would neuer haue graunted it, but at their intreatie.

                        <hi>An.</hi> 405.</note> there was aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled a Synod of the Weſterne Biſhops at Rome, where they entreated <hi>the Emperor Honorius to write to his brother Arcadius, requeſting him, that he would cauſe a Synod to be aſſembled at Theſſalonica, to the end that the Biſhops both of the Eaſt and alſo of the Weſt might there meet, as in a more conuenient place,</hi> for the finall hearing and ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of this cauſe. Whereupon <hi>Honorius</hi> ſent vnto him, and the more to ſhew him the good opinion which the Biſhops of the Weſt had of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> of manie let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which he had in his hands to that effect, he ſent him principally two, the one of <hi>Innocentius</hi> Biſhop of Rome, the other of <hi>Chromatius</hi> Biſhop of Aquileia: And the author himſelfe noteth, that the embaſſadors ſent vnto <hi>Arcadius</hi> from his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Honorius,</hi> deliuered him letters <hi>from the Emperour his brother, from Innocentius of Rome, from Chromatius of Aquileia, from Venerius of Milan, and from ſundrie others;</hi> all which joyned in this embaſſage: the end whereof was, to reeſtabliſh <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in his place for the preſent, vntill a Generall Councell might be aſſembled. In the meane time <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> died in baniſhment, and the reſt of this Hiſtorie concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not this matter. What reaſon therefore hath <hi>Baronius</hi> ſo confidently to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> did appeale to Rome? For when a Prince oppreſſed by one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> neighbour, flyeth for helpe and ſuccour to another, doth he thereby make him his Lord, and himſelfe his vaſſall? To flie to his courteſie or fauour, is it to be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for an acknowledgement of his juriſdiction, or that he confeſſeth himſelfe his tributarie?

                     </note> Fourthly, will you ſee (ſaith he) how much they attribute and yeeld to the Church of Rome? When they went about to ſet downe a certaine Canon of the Bible, they conſulted <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface</hi> thereupon, requeſting him to confirme it: and what likelyhood, that they would not vſe the like ſubmiſſion in the reſt of their Canons?

                     </note> 
                     <hi>It ſeemeth good vnto vs</hi> (ſay the Fathers in that Canon) <hi>that nothing be read in the Churches but onely the holie Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; which are theſe, Geneſis, Exodus, Leuiticus, &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore their reſolution and decree was abſolute without anie reſeruation, both that the Scriptures onely ſhould be read, and alſo which bookes they are which ought to be accounted for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Canonicall: onely for correſpondencies ſake they adde farther in theſe words, <hi>We will alſo that this be ſignified to our companion in Prieſthood Bonifacius, and others, to the end that they may confirme it; for ſo haue we receiued from the Fathers, that theſe onely ought to be read in Churches.</hi> Now if the Popes authoritie alone had beene neceſſarie to the validitie of this Canon, what needed they to ſignifie it vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? This therefore was nought elſe but a teſtimonie of their mutuall loue and charitie. <hi>Baronius</hi> here ſtormeth becauſe we ſay, That by occaſion of that forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Canon the whole Church of Afrike was cut off from the Communion of the Church of Rome; becauſe it thence followeth, that S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and ſuch a multitude of other holie Fathers died out of the Communion of the Church of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Rome, and excommunicated by the Pope: and thereupon ſeeketh by all meanes to diſcredit that Epiſtle of <hi>Bonifacius</hi> the ſecond, which teſtifieth, that they were not reunited till a full hundred yeares after. I confeſſe, that whereas it is there ſaid, Vnder the reigne of <hi>Iustin;</hi> the miſtake was eaſier of <hi>Iuſtin</hi> for <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> than that of Nicene for Sardican, and the inconuenience thence ariſing is verie great: for what then ſhall become of ſo manie Martyrs, put to death during thoſe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares, vnder the perſecution and tyrannie of the Vandales?

                     <hi>Knowing well</hi> (ſaith <hi>Baronius) that a Generall Councell could not be aſsembled without his authoritie: a thing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>deepely to be grauen in the readers memorie.</hi> But now what proofe? <hi>Leo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the beginning of his Epiſtle to the Synod of Epheſus telleth them in this manner: The religious Emperour hath yeelded this reſpect and reuerence to the diuine ordinances, to vſe the authoritie of the Apoſtolike See, for the bringing of his holie intents and purpoſes to paſse.</hi> All which I confeſſe, was fit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit to be done: but is there no difference whether the Emperour call <hi>Leo</hi> to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Councell, or <hi>Leo</hi> him; or whether the Emperor by his authoritie call a Councell?

True it is, that they were willing to draw <hi>Leo</hi> to ſome reaſon by faire words and remonſtrances which they made vnto him: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> this was the drift and purpoſe of that Epiſtle.

                     <hi>He knew well</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that to aſsem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Synod of Orthodox Biſhops appertained not to him, and therefore treading the ſteps of his predeceſſors, he aſsembled it by the authoritie of Pope Symmachus, and the verie Acts of the Councell teſtifie as much.</hi> And then falleth he to his accuſtomed accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                     <hi>A memorable matter</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that a Prince, a Barbarian, a Goth by nation, a ſtranger, an heretike, and an Arrian, do the ſchiſmatikes what they could by importuning him to the contrarie, ſhould yet yeeld ſuch reſpect and reuerence to the See Apoſtolike.</hi> But what if the whole proceedings and the Acts themſelues of this Synod ſhew the contrarie?

                     <hi>The Synod here aſſembled out of diuers countries, by the commandement of the moſt religious King Theodorie &amp;c.</hi> And againe, <hi>The Royall authoritie hauing ſo commaunded, that the Biſhops ſhould aſſemble here at Rome out of diuers Prouinces &amp;c.</hi> The reaſon is, for that one Metropolitan hath no power ouer another: and therefore when Biſhops of diuers Prouinces had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to aſſemble themſelues in a Synod, it could not be done without the Kings authoritie: and in this Synod were preſent the Biſhops of Liguria, Emilia, and Venice, to decide this cauſe, wherein the Biſhop of Rome was defendant. Yea, but ſaith <hi>Baronius,</hi> the Biſhops told him, that it belonged not vnto him; true: but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> read on, and you ſhall find that he replied, <hi>That the Pope himſelfe had by his letters declared his will touching the calling of this Synod:</hi> which was, that <hi>Theodoric</hi> ſhould call it; and thereupon <hi>thanketh him for ſo doing,</hi> as hauing thereby giuen him the meanes to juſtifie and to cleare himſelfe. And it followeth afterward, <hi>That this Synod preſumed not to decree anie thing without making the King firſt acquainted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</hi> And againe it is there ſaid, <hi>That Symmachus was forced by the Emperour to enter the liſts againſt his aduerſaries, and that before the Fathers aſſembled in this Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, as before his lawfull Delegates or Commiſsioners:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Nunquam com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſiſſet.</note>

                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:15502:53"/>
Then follow the Acts themſelues, <hi>Whiles they were in deliberation what was fit to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> done, Symmachus came and offered to plead his cauſe:</hi> And hauing expreſſed the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences which his aduerſaries had vſed towards him, the Fathers ſpake and ſaid, <hi>That they muſt yet againe flie to the iuſtice of the Prince &amp;c.</hi> who declared there o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, <hi>That the knowledge and ordering of Church matters belonged vnto them: that he brought nothing but reuerence with him when he came to the hearing of ſuch cauſes: and that he committed it to the power of the Biſhops to heare or not to heare it, and to diſpoſe thereof at their diſcretion, prouided that by the care and wiſedome of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell the Chriſtians might haue peace within the Citie.</hi> By all which it appeareth, that he did not put off his authoritie from himſelfe, to conferre it vpon the Biſhop of Rome. In the end theſe Fathers proceeding according to the commaundement <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of the Prince, reſolued in this intricate cauſe to arbitrate and to compoſe the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, rather than as Iudges to decide it; and for the peace of the Church, to cloake offences, rather than to expoſe them to the view of the world: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commaunded they the people to receiue <hi>Symmachus</hi> againe; leauing the judgement to God, of thoſe things which could not ſufficiently be proued by men.

Beliſarius thereupon returned to Rome, and called Syluerius before him into the palace, layed to his charge, that he had entertained ſecret intelligence with the Gothes, to ſurpriſe the Citie: and it is reported, that one Marcus a ſcholer, and Iulian one of the gard, had forged certaine letters as from Syluerius to the King of the Gothes, whereby he was conuicted of conſpiracie againſt the Citie.

Did he giue the Title of Soueraigne Patriarch to any one of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Patriarches of the Eaſt? or did he denie himſelfe to be a Chriſtian? or when he forbiddeth them to giue this Title of <hi>Vniuerſall</hi> to any man, doth he exclude himſelfe out of the number of men?

                     </note> and vnto <hi>Narſes.</hi> It is true, that in the former of thoſe Epiſtles he complaineth, That whereas hee hauing written to him concerning certaine wrongs done to <hi>Iohn</hi> of Chalcedon, and to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> other Monkes of Iſauria, he made him anſwer, That he knew of no ſuch matter.

But what is all this to an Appeale to Rome, ſeeing that there is not ſo much as the name either of an Appeallant or of an Appeale to be found in all thoſe Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles? And as for thoſe 15, 16, 17 Epiſtles of <hi>Gregorie,</hi> which he citeth out of his fift booke, they proue nothing but this, That <hi>Iohn</hi> vpon the wrong which was done vnto him, had recourſe to <hi>Gregorie,</hi> who made his cauſe to be reuiewed in a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and his confeſſion being there found Orthodox, <hi>Gregorie</hi> requeſted the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of Conſtantinople to receiue him againe with fauour, as one which had beene abuſed and wronged by ſuch as he had put in truſt with the examination of his cauſe; and intreated the Emperour to aſſiſt him therein: all which ſauoureth not of the nature of an Appeale, but onely of that ancient recourſe which the oppreſſed vſed to make to the chiefe Sees; and which the Biſhop of Rome vſed commonly to draw to a conſequence of Soueraigntie and Dominion. The like is to be ſaid of the caſe of <hi>Adrian</hi> Biſhop of Thebes, whoſe <hi>proceſse,</hi> as hee ſaith,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:15502:73"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
                     <hi>Gregorie read ouer:</hi> for the Appeale there ſpoken of, vpon the accuſation which was mixt, and partly Ciuile partly Eccleſiaſticall, belonged properly to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile Court, in the point for which the Emperour in the firſt inſtance commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to <hi>Iohn</hi> Biſhop of Iuſtineana Prima; and ſecondarily to the Eccleſiaſticall Court, in that which concerned his depoſition. And <hi>Gregorie</hi> there ſpeaketh in verie proper tearmes, when he ſaith, <hi>That Adrian being wronged by his brethren and fellow Biſhop, as by his enemies, fled to the citie of Rome.</hi> And againe, He is, ſaith he,<note place="margin">Confugit.</note> come to Rome, <hi>to complaine with teares.</hi> And in like ſort doth <hi>Baronius</hi> abuſe the other examples which he alledgeth. Fiftly he ſaith, That <hi>Gregorie</hi> dealt about his Palls, amongſt the Archbiſhops of the Eaſt alſo: making vs beleeue, that this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> is as ancient as Chriſtianitie is old. And whereſoeuer the Biſhop of Rome writing to any Biſhop, ſaith vnto him, <hi>Vices tibi meas committo,</hi> i. <hi>I make you my Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car,</hi> he inferreth preſently, That he ſent him the Mantle or Pall withall: which he bringeth in, as if it had now ſuddenly ſprung out of the ground; it being a thing which former ages neuer heard of. But let vs ſee vpon what credit, though wee now come to enter into an age which was wholly ſet vpon new fangles and deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. For proofe hereof therefore hee citeth the 55 Epiſtle of <hi>Gregorie, lib.</hi> 4. whence he collecteth, That he beſtowed this Mantle or Pall vpon <hi>Iohn</hi> Biſhop of Corinth: whereas yet his words are onely theſe, <hi>You know,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that heretofore this Pall was giuen for money, but we haue taken a ſtrict order in a Synod,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pallium pro Commodo.</note> 
                     <hi>that neither <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> this, or any other order, ſhall hereafter be diſpoſed of either by money or by fauour.</hi> And I ſee no reaſon, but that by the ſame argument he might haue ſaid, That hee ſent him his Orders alſo. True it is, that the two Biſhops of Rome and of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople pulled who could pull hardeſt, to get all juriſdiction into their hands, as if the Church had beene a prey betweene them two: and this was the cauſe that <hi>Gregories</hi> letters ſlew ſo thicke as they did into Greece. And ſo much bee ſaid of the power which he chalenged ouer the Church.</p>
                  <p>As for the Emperour <hi>Maurice, Baronius</hi> taketh pepper in noſe againſt him; a man otherwiſe well reported of, and much commended by Hiſtorians. His grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance is onely this, That according to the law of his predeceſſors, he tooke vpon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> him to confirme <hi>Gregorie</hi> in his Popedome; and is ſcarce friends with <hi>Gregorie</hi> himſelfe for ſuffering it. In the end he ſaith, That the Emperour was a Tyran,<note place="margin">Baron. vol. <hi>8.</hi> an. <hi>590.</hi> art. <hi>2, 3, 4,</hi> &amp; ſequent.</note> and <hi>Gregorie</hi> forced to doe what he did: and that it was of this <hi>Maurice</hi> that he meant, when vpon the fift Penitentiall Pſalme he vſed theſe words, <hi>That he is no King who maketh the Church a Chamber-maid, whom God appointed to be free and Miſtreſse of the houſe:</hi> if ſo, then was <hi>Gregorie</hi> a notorious hypocrite; neither is there any tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of him, ſeeing that he ſaid one thing and meant another, in all the dealings which he had with <hi>Maurice.</hi> For doe but read the Epiſtle which he wrot vnto <hi>Maurice,</hi> concerning that law which he had made to this effect, That no ſouldier vntill he were diſmiſſed, no accomptant without his diſcharge firſt had and obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſhould take the Frocke vpon him, and enter into religion: and then tell me whether it be poſſible for a man to vſe greater ſubmiſſion than he there vſeth? <hi>He is anſwerable,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for it before Almightie God, whoſoeuer is either in word or deed found faultie againſt his gracious Lords: And ſo were I your moſt vnworthie ſeruant, if in this caſe I ſhould hold my peace, &amp;c.</hi>

Wherefore as it hath beene alreadie ſaid, the appropriating of this title to the Biſhop of Rome was from <hi>Phocas:</hi> and from thence came that ſeperation and rent betweene the Churches of the Eaſt and Weſt, which dureth vnto this day, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and ſerueth for a remarkable period in the Church, for that S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> ſo often doth inculcate it in his writings, That this was the time when Antichriſt began to ſet foot into the world.

               <p>TO fulfill the propheſie of the Apocalyps, it was neceſſarie that the ſecond Beaſt ſhould enter vpon the place of the firſt; and the Empire declining, and the Apoſtaſie encreaſing, the Papacie ſhould plant it ſelfe in the roome of the Empire. The Emperours were long ſince confined in the Eaſt: but the Exarches of Rauenna, who had alwayes their Iudges vnder them at Rome, remained ſtill as a moat, or rather a thorne in the Popes eye: and the Lombards on the other ſide held them continually at a bay, and in feare of a ſudden flaw: and now ſhall we ſee how cunningly they rid themſelues of both. Immediatly vpon the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiew betweene the Emperour <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Pope, <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> by the armie, was aſſaulted by <hi>Helias</hi> Generall of the armie for <hi>Philippicus Bardanes,</hi> who ſlew him, and farther cauſed his ſonne <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who was fled to the Temple of Blachames, to be there murdered, and then ſent <hi>Iuſtinians</hi> head to <hi>Philippicus,</hi> and he to Rome. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Pope ſomewhat amazed with this ſudden alteration, yet bethought himſelfe how to doe moſt for his owne behoofe. There was at that time a certaine Monke called <hi>Iohn,</hi> who had perſuaded <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> to turne Monothelite, which Hereſie had beene formerly condemned in the ſixt generall Councell. And <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> had cauſed the chiefe of thoſe Fathers which aſſiſted at that Councell to be pictured in a table, and to be hung vp in the poarch of S. Sophia in Conſtantinople. <hi>Philippicus,</hi> by the perſuaſion of that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Monke, defaced this table; and farther commaunded, That all Images ſhould be pulled downe in the Churches: A good ordinance, had it not proceeded from an hereticall diſpoſition. On the contrarie <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Pope, in deſpight of <hi>Philippicus,</hi> cauſed a table, containing the Images not onely of the Fathers of the ſixt Councell, but of all the ſix generall Synods, to be hung vp in Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Church at Rome; and in a Synod there ordained, That Images ſhould be ſet vp in Churches: So the queſtion about Images came now to be principall, which at the firſt was but acceſſarie. Inſomuch that from thence forward, though the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour elected were neuer ſo Orthodox in other points, and though he receiued the ſix generall Synods with all readineſſe, yet was hee not obeyed nor acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> by the Popes, or at all in Italie, if he held not for the vſe and veneration of Images, which by circumſtances they made alwayes more and more odious to the aduerſe partie: So that vpon this point the Popes neuer wanted matter of quarell againſt the Emperours, till in the end they had thruſt them cleane out of Italie. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> therefore, taking occaſion as before, refuſed <hi>Philippicus</hi> his Patents, which he ſent vnto him, pronounced him an Heretike, forbad the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Rome to receiue either <hi>his name, or his letters, or his image, or his coyne:</hi> ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not his pourtrait <hi>to be placed in the Church,</hi>

Yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> was this law tranſgreſſed in the next election, which was but one yeare after, of <hi>Paſchal</hi> in the roome of this <hi>Stephen.</hi> This <hi>Paſchal being ſolemnely and fully conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated,</hi> ſent away preſents and letters of excuſe vnto the Emperour,<note place="margin">Aimoni. li. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>105.</hi> poſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletam ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ordinatione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> telling him, that the Papacie was layed vpon him againſt his will, and after much reſiſtance.

Here the Hiſtorians of the Popes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> produce a certaine graunt, pretended to haue been made by this <hi>Lewis;</hi> which the more ample it is, the more alſo is it to be ſuſpected: And this is the firſt Graunt which is ſuffered to come abroad; as for thoſe others of <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Pepin,</hi> they only quote them, but produce them not to our ſcanning, eſpecially that of <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maigne,</hi> produced by <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anaſtaſ. in Adriano.</note> of the ſame ſtile &amp; tenor with that Palea of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> though written ſo long after, &amp; in ſo different an age: which graunt of <hi>Lewis</hi> containeth (as they ſay) an abſolute renunciation of all right in the election of Popes, expreſſed in the Canon <hi>Adrianus,</hi> recited all at length by <hi>Sigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> and <hi>Baronius,</hi> and taken by them word for word out of the Decrete of <hi>Gratian,</hi> which the more learned ſort haue euer rejected as falſe and counterfeit, and that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> for many reaſons. Firſt, for that many lands and lordſhips are paſſed in that grant, which we find many yeres after compriſed in that donation which <hi>Maud</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe made vnto the Church. Secondly, becauſe that of manie of thoſe lands there paſſed, the ſucceſſors of <hi>Lewis</hi> diſpoſed as of their owne. Thirdly, becauſe there are graunted manie Prouinces, Iſlands, Demaines, Ports, and Riuers, vnto which the Emperour <hi>Lewis</hi> neuer did or could lay anie claime, and which in the treatie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Emperors, were left for a partage properly belonging to the Emperor of the Eaſt. Fourthly, becauſe <hi>Lewis</hi> giuing Italie afterwards to one of his ſonnes
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:15502:93"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> for his portion, had left him ſmall meanes to ſupport his eſtate, if beſides the part of the Grecian Emperour and the ſtate of Venice, all thoſe lands compriſed in that donation had beene taken out of it. Fifthly, becauſe the Citie of Rome was long after gouerned by the officers of the Empire, and the Popes Buls dated (as <hi>Guicciardine</hi> recordeth) <hi>Imperante domino noſtro &amp;c.</hi> Sixtly, becauſe this renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not found obſerued in thoſe Elections which enſued afterward: which were (as we ſhall hereafter ſee) ordered and confirmed by the Emperours; who tooke it in great redainder, if anie thing happened to be attempted to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie. Seuenthly, becauſe the Authors of that time, as <hi>Nitare, Aimonius,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Annaliſts make no mention thereof, no not <hi>Anastaſius</hi> himſelfe in the life of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  <hi>Paſchal,</hi> who for the good will he bare vnto the Popes, would not haue omitted ſo high a point of their honour. Eightly, becauſe the Popes neuer pretended anie ſuch grant, vntill long after, and when the houſe of <hi>Charlemaigne</hi> was fallen to the ground.

And <hi>Sylueſter</hi> the ſecond accepted of this donation, though he vnderſtood his writings as Lawyer like as anie Pope that went before him. But whether that donation of <hi>Lewis</hi> be true or falſe, we cannot doubt of their ambitious encroaching vpon other mens eſtates, ſeeing that <hi>Paſchal</hi> pulled out the eyes and cut off the noſe of <hi>Theodore,</hi>

the Pope had purged himſelfe by oath in the preſence of manie Biſhops, and had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> taken the murderers into his protection, as belonging to the familie of S. <hi>Peter, pronouncing thoſe that were ſlaine guiltie of treaſon,</hi>

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:15502:99"/>
ſhe was choſen Pope in his roome. But not long after, being great with child by her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> hauing for a while hid her great bellie, in the end going to Latran, betweene the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, which they call the Coloſſe of Nero and S.

Some write, that vpon this occaſion the Pope when he goeth to Latran, ſhunneth this ſtreet of purpoſe: and that to preuent the like inconuenience in time to come, when the Pope firſt ſitteth in S. Peters Chaire, wherein is a hole made for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the punie Deacon is to handle his priuities. I will not denie the first to be true: for the ſecond, I ſuppoſe that the Chaire is ſo pierced, to the end that he which ſhall be ſet in ſo high a place, may know that he is a man and no God, and ſubiect to like neceſsities of nature as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men are: and therefore it is called Sedes Stercoraria;</hi> we in Engliſh may call it by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> a more cleanelie name, a cloſe-ſtoole.

And we muſt now enter the liſts of this queſtion, becauſe this Hiſtorie (which euer heretofore paſſed for currant without contradiction) fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in theſe daies ſome oppoſition: eſpecially <hi>Onuphrius</hi> vpon <hi>Platina</hi> thinketh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> himſelfe ſufficiently armed with reaſons to euict this report as fabulous.<note place="margin">Onuphrius ad Plat. in vitae Johan. <hi>8.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And ſhall all this be rejected, by ſaying onely that <hi>Martin</hi> ſaid it?

And we anſwere, let them ſubtract from the next precedent Popes the time which they haue added to them ouer and aboue the account of <hi>Marianus Scotus,</hi> and other auncient Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clers, and ſhe will not want a place to ſtand in: For <hi>Onuphrius</hi> giueth to <hi>Sergi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the ſecond two moneths more than <hi>Marianus</hi> doth: to <hi>Nicholas</hi> the firſt he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth nine yeares, ſix moneths, twentie dayes, whom <hi>Marianus</hi> maketh to ſit but eight yeare, nine dayes: to <hi>Adrian</hi> the ſecond he giueth foure yeares and eleuen moneths, whereas <hi>Marianus</hi> affoordeth him onely but two yeares. And ſo may <hi>Onuphrius</hi> eaſily caſt vp his account, and we find the totall of ours. So likewiſe <hi>Hermannus Contractus,</hi> to leaue no roome for this <hi>Ione,</hi> caſteth three yeares vpon <hi>Sergius,</hi> and nine vpon <hi>Leo</hi> the fourth: and ſo doe the reſt which are alledged by <hi>Onuphrius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly they ſay, That vnto the time of Pope <hi>Formoſus,</hi> that is for the ſpace of nine hundred yeares complete, there was neuer anie Pope choſen, who had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> not beene brought vp from a child in the Church of Rome, and riſen by degrees of Prieſthood or Deaconrie. We anſwere, let them reforme then the generall current of Hiſtories, which report, That <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> brother to the Duke of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pete, was choſen Pope in the yeare 767, which was neither Prieſt, nor Deacon, nor Clerke, but tooke all his degrees in a day, and was conſecrated by the Biſhops of Praeneſte, Alba, and Port, and ſat one yeare and one moneth: ſince which time they cannot denie but that meere lay men haue beene elected Popes. Thirdly, they come to ſcan the words of the Hiſtorie of <hi>Martin: Anglicus, natione Mogun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus,</hi> an Engliſhman borne at Mence: What greater abſurditie ſaith he? But the abſurditie is their owne, and not the Authors, for <hi>Engliſh</hi> was her ſurname, not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the name of her nation: and themſelues obſerue, that in the better manuſcripts it is written <hi>Anglicus,</hi> not <hi>Anglus.</hi> Neither did anie euer vnderſtand it otherwiſe, no not <hi>Faſciculus Temporum,</hi> where he writeth in this manner, <hi>Some men</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>report, that they neuer make Popes of Germanes, which is falſe.</hi> Beſides that, <hi>Polonus</hi> ſayth, a Margantine or Mangantine by nation, and by conſequent no Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Fourthly they ſay, That <hi>Martin</hi> maketh her a ſtudent of Athens, whereas at that time there was no learning there, but barbariſme, prouing it by <hi>Syneſius,</hi> who ſo reporteth of it in his time.<note place="margin">Syneſ. in poſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma epiſt. ad fratrem.</note> We anſwere, that <hi>Syneſius</hi> ſayth not there was no learning there, but not ſo much as he expected; and it was no ſmall matter that could adde to the learning of <hi>Syneſius:</hi> but it is apparent, that in Greece there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> were Vniuerſities, continuing manie yeares after, at Athens, at Theſſalonica, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, and a famous one in the Iſle of Chio, ſince that inundation of the Turkes: and in this verie time of which we ſpeake, <hi>Zonaras</hi> telleth vs, that <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Bardas</hi> the Emperour reſtored learning there: and therefore as learning was not then in her heat at Athens, ſo was it not likewiſe cleane extinguiſhed. And whereas they ſay, that at this time there were no Lectures of Diuinitie at Rome (a goodlie commendation for the See of the pretended Head of the Church) we anſwere them, that this great ſcarcitie bred her the greater admiration. Fiftly,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:15502:100"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> they examine the circumſtances: <hi>Martin</hi> ſaith it was done as ſhe went from Saint <hi>Peters</hi> to the Latran; and the Popes (ſay they) at that time dwelt not in the Vati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can. But we aske, whether then and a long time before S. <hi>Peters</hi> Church was not built, that ſo the Pope might goe from the one to the other in proceſſion? And then they ſay it is ſtrange, that in all thoſe nine moneths no bodie ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it. We anſwere, that there is nothing more common: but ſhould they not rather admire the judgement of God, in proclaiming their abhomination by this myſterie? Sixtly, not being able to denie, that the Popes vſe to turne out of this way; they alledge a wrong cauſe of their ſo doing, ſaying, That if they went the right way, the ſtreets would be too narrow for the preaſe of people? We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that they who haue ſeene the place, know the contrarie: But <hi>Platina</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth it in thoſe words, <hi>De primo non abnuerim.</hi> For the firſt, I will not denie it, and the effigies erected vpon the place (as <hi>Antonine</hi> reporteth) auerreth as much, which the Ieſuites themſelues cannot denie: But willing to ſeeme more vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding than he, they would faine perſuade vs, that this is the pourtrait of a Prieſt going to ſay Maſſe, with the Clerke at his heeles. A man may well ſay, that this is <hi>Raſura in loco ſuſpecto:</hi> for what ſhould ſuch an Image make in that place? Seuenthly, for the cloſe ſtoole, they paſſe it ouer in a word, That this is an idle tale of the people; others ſay by way of Allegorie, that this is to ſhew the new elected, <hi>that God raiſeth the poore out of the dung.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Erigit è ſtercore pauperem. Antiquit. de Fauchet. vol. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> But for the matter it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſelfe, can they denie, but that the ſtoole is yet to be ſeene in the gallerie of the Palace of Latran, as they goe to the Chappell called <hi>Sancta Sanctorum,</hi> where the Conclaue was wont to be held while the Popes dwelt there? And as for the cauſe, if it were ſuch as they ſay, why then is there <hi>a hole</hi> in it? And why ſhould not we beleeue ſo manie Authors? And the verſes of <hi>Iohannes Pannonius,</hi> long before this controuerſie was riſen, doe they not teſtifie as much?</p>

                  <p>Meaning that now Popes vſe before hand to trie their manhood by their wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and begetting of baſtards. Eightly they ſay, That <hi>Zonaras, Nicetas, Cedre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and others ſpeake not of it. We anſwere, that theſe Authors liued long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſpeake principally of the affaires of Greece, and but ſleightly of them neither. And I would know, if in a matter of the Latine Church we ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a Greeke Author, whether they would not preſently call vs to the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Latines? And what wonder, if theſe idolatrous Monkes, ſhaking hands with the beaſtlineſſe of the Romane Church, were willing to conceale this ſhame? But <hi>Laonicus,</hi> a Greeke Author, was not ignorant of this report, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> though farre from ſuch affections. He deſcribing the election of Popes, as it was wont to be made in his dayes, writeth in this manner, <hi>After that the voices are gathered, and the Pope declared, they keepe him that is elected in the houſe</hi> (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning where the Election is made) <hi>if the houſe be otherwiſe fit for ſuch a purpoſe: and then pronouncing him Pope, they make him ſit downe in a bottomeleſſe chaire, to the end that ſome one appointed for this purpoſe may touch his priuities; whereby it may appeare that he is a man: For it is certaine, that there was a woman made a Pope, by error of her ſex, becauſe it is the faſhion of the Italians to weare their beards ſhauen:
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:15502:101"/>
and this woman being begot with child, as ſhe went in proceſsion, was deliuered in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the middeſt of her deuotion, in the ſight of all the people: And therefore to auoid the like inconuenience, and to be ſure of what they goe about, one toucheth the priuities of the Pope, and he that handleth them crieth out,</hi> Mas nobis dominus eſt, <hi>i. We haue a male creature to our Lord and Maſter:</hi> and ſo goeth on with the other ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies obſerued in that election. <hi>Baronius</hi> in the meane time is well holpen vp to ſend vs to <hi>Remondus,</hi> who ſayth, That all this was added by his interpreter <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerus,</hi> but without all authoritie or other proofe, ſaue onely that <hi>Viginer</hi> (who tranſlated him into French) hath indeed left it all out, in fauour of the Popes. But that they may not ſay that <hi>Laonicus</hi> onely of the Greekes reporteth it,<note place="margin">Barlaamus in dialog. de prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipat. Papae.</note> I can bring you another, <hi>Barlaamus,</hi> a Greeke writer, in his Dialogue touching the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Primacie of the Pope, maketh mention alſo of a ſtrumpet woman, who was made a Pope; yet <hi>Onuphrius</hi> followeth the chaſe, and <hi>Baronius</hi> commeth to the reſcue. And firſt he objecteth, That <hi>Nicholas</hi> the firſt, which came ſhortly after this time, would not (writing to <hi>Michael</hi> the Emperour) haue ſaid ſo boldly as he doth, <hi>Our predeceſſors of happie memorie, Leo and Benedict,</hi> who had had a fit occaſion to run vpon him in tearmes, if anie ſuch matter had beene: So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe had <hi>Photius,</hi> Archbiſhop of Conſtantinople, and a mortall enemie to the Pope of Rome. We ſay, that what anſwere the Emperour made him, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell for want of his Epiſtle, and for ought we know he did not ſpare to tell the Pope of one that was betweene thoſe his two predeceſſors. And it is likely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that he did: for it appeareth by the replie which Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> made vnto his anſwere, that he had ſtung him, ſeeing that he reproacheth the Emperour, <hi>for beginning his letters with iniurious and opprobrious ſpeeches, againſt the mother of all other Churches,</hi> and excuſeth himſelfe <hi>for not anſwering to manie points of his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, containing blaſphemie againſt the holie See, written</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with the poyſon of a Serpent rather than with inke,</hi> and that <hi>therefore he choſe rather wiſely to contemne them &amp;c.</hi> And therefore we may thinke, that in ſo long a letter, or rather a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, ſuch a matter as this could not be forgotten: and who knoweth not, that <hi>Nicholas</hi> (whom it concerned to ſuppreſſe the memorie of this infamie, and to raze it out of all Regiſters) was no wayes bound in his anſwere to name it anie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> more?

                     </note> to blot out the memorie thereof for euer. Againe (ſaith <hi>Baronius</hi>) it may be that <hi>Marianus,</hi> who firſt mentioned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> this ſhee-Pope, had heard ſay of one <hi>Cyrillus,</hi> a mignion of the Emperour <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,</hi> whom he would oftentimes make to play the Patriarch in ſcorne of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and holie things, inſomuch that once he deceiued the old Empreſſe his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and that what was done at Conſtantinople he reported as done at Rome, that of a mignion he made a woman, and of this play of a Patriarch a ſhee-Pope. But how ſhould this poore Monke make ſo manie metamorphoſes? Who could tell him what paſſed in Greece? And ſeeing this mockerie of <hi>Michael</hi> was

                     </note> That in the time of <hi>Marianus, Leo</hi> the ninth in an Epiſtle which he wrote vnto <hi>Michael</hi> Patriarch of Conſtantinople, reproacheth him, for that contrarie to the Nicene Canons they elected Eunuchs to their See, and that there was a report, that they had alſo beene couſened with a woman; to ſay nothing that the moſt part of theſe Epiſtles are forged, what probabilitie, that <hi>Marianus</hi> hearing ſpeech <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of ſuch a thing done at Conſtantinople in his time, ſhould report it as done at Rome, ſo manie yeares before? And where was either his wit or his honeſtie, when he ſo preciſely quoted the yeares, moneths, and dayes?

So that, ſaith the Hiſtorian, <hi>when the Emperour ſaw fit time he came to Rome, where he was honourably receiued by great and ſmall: the Archbiſhop of Rauenna came alſo with him, not fearing the Popes threats; which ſtrooke yet a greater heat betweene the Emperour and the Pope. For the Emperor taking vp his lodging at Saint Peters Palace, and the Pope lying at the holie Apostles, when he ſaw that whateuer he attempted againſt the Royall Dignitie came to naught, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed certaine Monkes and Nunnes</hi> (theſe were their old prankes) <hi>of the Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> about Rome, who euerie morning, by way of deuotion, went ſaying the Letanie round about the walls, and ſinging Maſſes againſt bad Princes. The great ones about the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour vnderſtanding hereof, went to the Pope, entreated him kindly to forbid ſuch doings: but not able to preuaile with him, went their wayes diſcontent. It fell out ſhortly after, that ſome of the ſouldiers going to Paules, lighted vpon theſe Letanies, who through the inſtigation of the old enemie, were thereupon moued to choler, and in duetie to their Lord, reuenged them of theſe wrongs done vnto him, wounded many of them, and made all take their heeles and run away, caſting downe Croſſes and Images which they carried in proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, after the manner of the Greekes, whereof ſome were broken, and others trampled vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot. The Emperour hereupon grew much offended, and the Pope ſomewhat calmer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> than before, and went to the Emperours lodging, to entreat for thoſe of his companie who had committed that offence, and hardly could obtaine for them. And from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they grew more familiar than before: But the Imperiall authoritie was ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at Rome.</hi> Thus we ſee how little he got by his Excommunication bolted out againſt the Archbiſhop of Rauenna. The Iniunction alſo which he laid vpon him, to come once in euerie two yeares to Rome, turned to his loſſe: for he ſaw indeed the Archbiſhop at Rome oftner than he was willing, becauſe he was euer borne out and maintained by the Emperour. But aboue all it troubled the Popes conſcience to ſee ſo great an authoritie ſo neere at hand, ouerſhadowing his own, as leſſe offenſiue when it was farther off: For, ſaith the ſame Author, whoſe verie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſimplicitie is warrant ynough for his truth and honeſtie, <hi>this Emperour, becauſe hee reſided ſtill in Italie, made himſelfe alwayes a neere neighbour to Rome, and exerciſed his authoritie to the full, being aſsiſted by the chiefe of the citie: who knew themſelues, and gaue alſo the Emperour to vnderſtand, the ancient cuſtomes of the Empire: perſuading him to reſume into his owne hands the Soueraigntie and commaund which in alder times belonged to the Emperours. Which no doubt he would haue done, but for the reuerence which he bore to the holie Apoſtles</hi> (which reuerence yet was ſuch, as that it pleaſed not the Popes:) <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>whiles theſe matters ſo paſſed, the Biſhops of Rome ſent

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Neither was there anie ſtronger beleefe in Germanie of the Popes not erring, than you haue heard in France; as appeared when he went about to eſtabliſh his Decree of Single life: For hauing directed it to <hi>Vldaric</hi> Biſhop of Ausbourg, with charge to put it in execution (not to rehearſe what he ſaid of the queſtion it ſelfe, which we haue elſewhere ſet downe more at large) he telleth him in plaine tearmes, <hi>That he was deuoid of reaſon, vniuſt, and inſupportable: That hardly could the members of the bodie continue ſound, ſeeing the Head was ſo ill affected, ſo farre eſtranged from true diſcretion,</hi> contrarie to the Euangelicall Inſtitution, contrarie to the foretelling of the holie Spirit, to the examples of manie holie men, and the common aduiſe of the wiſer ſort, exhorting him to remoue this <hi>Phariſaicall, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſcandalous, and pestilent doctrine</hi> from the flocke of Chriſt: and the verie ſtile it ſelfe of this Epiſtle is a ſufficient warrant againſt all forgerie, to thoſe who know what belongeth to it.</p>
                  <p>This Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> went yet farther: for <hi>Michael Bardas,</hi> vncle to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Michael,</hi> ſucceeding in the Empire, had diuorced his wife, and was married to his daughter in law: <hi>Ignatius</hi> Patriarch of Conſtantinople cut him off for this ſinne from the vnion of the Church. <hi>Bardas</hi> offended herewith, aſſembled a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, depoſed <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and put one <hi>Photius</hi> in his place: whereupon aroſe a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinie in Conſtantinople, ſome holding for <hi>Photius,</hi> others for <hi>Ignatius.</hi> The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, to ſtint this ſtrife, requeſted the Pope to ſend his Legats thither, who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> preſently diſpatched away <hi>Rodoald</hi> Biſhop of Port, and <hi>Zacharie</hi> of Anagnia, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them inſtructions withall, to ſet vp Images againe, and aboue all to get in, if they could, <hi>his old patrimonie of Sicile and Calabria.</hi> Theſe Legats, contrarie to his imagination (woon as it ſhould ſeeme by the Emperour) ratified the depoſition of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and inſtallation of <hi>Photius.

Now in the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this matter we are eſpecially to obſerue the anſwere which he made vnto the Emperour, who in his letters to him had ſufficiently made knowne vnto him, That he deſired not his helpe as to judge of a cauſe alreadie ſentenced, but onely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> for the more eaſie execution of the ſentence giuen, and for the more ſpeedie pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying of the troubles enſuing thereupon: and it is great pitie that we haue not his letter at large, but muſt be content with ſo much of it as the Pope is pleaſed to alledge vnto vs. But we may by <hi>Nicholas</hi> his anſweres eaſily perceiue, that <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> ſpake mainely againſt his Primacie, becauſe he is ſo earneſt in the defence thereof: <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if they which ſit in Moſes chaire ought to be heard,</hi>

Or ſhould he not rather haue ſhewed, that at leaſt ſome one Archbiſhop of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople had beene ordained by them? Thirdly, he alledgeth the Councell of Chalcedon, where it is ſaid (ſaith he) in this manner, <hi>If a Clergie man hath a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie, either againſt his owne Biſhop, or against anie other, let the cauſe be heard in a Prouinciall Synod: if a Biſhop or a Clerke complaine againſt a Metropolitan of the ſame Prouince, let him repaire to the Primat of the Dioces, or to the See of Conſtantinople.</hi>

                  <p>Now in ſtead of repreſſing the impietie of this Emperour, they made good vſe of it; for, to make it yet more euidently to appeare, that they aimed at no other marke but onely at the greatneſſe of the Clergie: in the 14 Canon it is thus ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>That Biſhops ſhould not goe forth to meet Princes, and that when they happened to meet with them, they ſhould not alight from their Mules or Horſes: That Princes and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſhould hold them as fellowes and equall to themſelues: If anie Biſhop ſhall liue baſe and meanely, or rustically after the old faſhion, that he ſhall be depoſed for a whole yeare: if the Prince be cauſe of his ſo liuing, that he be excommunicated for two yeares.</hi> And the 17 Canon forbiddeth Princes and Emperours <hi>to be preſent at Synods, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be at generall Councels.</hi> And the 22 <hi>diſableth them and all Laies whomſoeuer to be preſent at the election or promotion of anie Patriarch, Metropolitan, or Biſhop, vnder paine of excommunication:</hi> whereby no doubt the Popes Legats thought they had ſhut the Emperours of the Weſt cleane out of their Conclaues, vſing one Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour as a rod alwaies to ſcourge the other. As for the point of Appeales to Rome, they could not effect it: for the 26 Canon is plaine, <hi>That who ſo findeth himſelfe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> aggrieued with his Biſhop, ſhall appeale to his Metropolitan, and from the Metropolitan to the Patriarch,</hi> à quo litibus finis imponatur, <hi>who ſhall make a full end of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie:</hi> and therefore meant not to run to Rome, as <hi>Nicholas</hi> would haue had them.

The Bulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians requeſted, That the matter might be reſolued and agreed vpon with the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats of other Patriarches there preſent. The Romaniſts replied, That there was no more to be done with them: and therefore, without euer putting it to the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, pronounced abſolutely, That they muſt belong to Rome. The Eaſterne Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops put this queſtion to the Bulgarians, <hi>When you firſt tooke the countrey,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>from whom tooke ye it? and the Prieſts which you found there, were they Greekes or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines?</hi> They anſwered, <hi>That they tooke the countrey from the Grecians, and that they found there none but Greeke Biſhops.</hi> Whereuppn the Eaſterne Biſhops inferred,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> That they were doubtleſſe ordained at Conſtantinople, and ſo conſequently ſhould belong to that Church. Thereupon the Legats replied, That Churches were not bounded by the diuerſitie of tongues: That kingdomes and Sees diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in their juriſdictions: That they had the preſumption on their ſide, who had giuen them their firſt Biſhops: That all Epirus, Thaſſalie, and Dardania, had bin euer belonging to their juriſdiction. The Eaſterne Biſhops on the contrarie, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded vpon which of theſe they would principally ſtand. In the end the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and pride of the Roman Legats ouerſwayed, who told the Synod, <hi>That the Church of Rome held not that Councel for a competent Iudge of her controuerſies, who was her ſelfe, by ſpeciall prerogatiue, to iudge of all other Churches: That, decree they what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> them luſted, it ſhould be as little regarded, as it was lightly enacted: That from this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, they, by the authoritie of the holie Ghoſt, pronounced a nullitie in whatſoeuer they ſhould decree, vntill the See of Rome had determined thereof.</hi> And ſo the holie Ghoſt, who was to Preſide in the Councell, Reſided onely in their perſons. And they farther adiured the Patriarch <hi>Ignatius,</hi> by the authoritie of the Apoſtles and of <hi>Adrian,</hi> who had reſtored him to his See, not to ſuffer Bulgaria to be taken from them. Who made them a doubtfull anſwer, telling them. <hi>That he was neither ſo young as to be lightly deceiued, neither yet ſo verie a dotard, as to do that himſelfe which he found fault withall in others.</hi> And there reſted this conteſtation betweene them, being queſtionleſſe a great ſcandall to the conſciences of theſe poore conuerts,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> who ſaw at firſt that theſe men ſought not the enlargement of Chriſts kingdome, but of their owne juriſdiction; and iniurious to the Emperour, who offended with theſe proceedings, though diſſembling it, tooke no order for their paſſe and ſafe-conduct into their countrey: So that hauing been certaine dayes at ſea, they fell into the hands of the Sclauons, who ſtript them of all that euer they had, took away the original of the Councell, with the ſubſcriptions of the Biſhops, and left them nothing but the copie of <hi>Athanaſius;</hi> and had peraduenture loſt their liues, but that ſome of their companie eſcaping, the Sclauons feared the matter might come to light, and they one day receiue the like meaſure. The iſſue of all was, That doe <hi>Adrian</hi> what he could, the Bulgarians put out the Latine Prieſts, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſent for others in their roomes to Conſtantinople; and ſo remained they in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to that Church. Whereupon they grew ſo odious to the Popes, that they called that ſinne condemned from heauen, after their name, Bulgarie, thereby to make them odious and abhominable to all men.

And we let you to know, you which by letters your (little befitting the authoritie of a king, much leſſe the humble modeſtie of a Biſhop) haue diſgraced vs by reproches, that you make vs write vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you otherwiſe than we would; to the end that you may perceiue that we are a man, though ſubiect to mens paſsions, yet one that walketh in the Image of God, not void of common ſenſe, raiſed to this kinglie throne by the grace of God, and by right of ſucceſsion to our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and grandfather: and which is more than this, a Chriſtian, a Catholike, an obſeruer of the Orthodox and true religion, brought vp from our cradle as well in knowledge of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Scriptures, as in the vnderſtanding of good and wholeſome lawes, both Eccleſiaſticall and Ciuile, not accuſed either Legally or Canonically in any Epiſcopall audience, much leſſe conuicted of any publike and notorious crime; who yet haue not beene able to preuaile ſo farre by our honourable letters, as to receiue any reaſonable anſwer from you, nor yet to haue that reſpect and due regard as was wont to paſſe betweene your predeceſſors and ours, &amp;c. In the entrance of your letters you commend indeed our wiſdome, but preſently you charge vs (in ſhew more fairely, in effect more grieuouſly) with murmuring, repining, &amp; grutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt your Fatherhood, with ſundrie other reproaches and imputations.

For our owne part, wee would not beleeue that thoſe letters came from you, becauſe the holie See hath euer beene woont to correct euerie man according to his qualitie and ranke, with good ſobrietie and diſcretion. Now if we haue ſpoken euill, beare witneſse of the euill; but if well, why grow you into ſuch choler againſt vs? Abraham could ſay vnto God, and God tooke it not in ill part, Wilt thou deſtroy the iuſt with the wicked; and yet you grow much offended, when we tell you, That you ought not to pronounce any man guiltie of a crime, without either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of the partie, or conuiction by courſe of law, much leſſe vſe a king as a priuat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and condemne him as conuicted. You are not ignorant, how great a ſinne it is, to ſay <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> vnto his brother, Racha; how much greater to ſay ſo to a king, both by the doctrine of the Apoſtle, and by the practiſe of Dauid in the perſon of Saul, though a reprobat from God? And yet in your letters you aduiſe vs, to receiue ioyfully, and with an humble heart, all that commeth from the Apoſtolike See of Rome: Is it your meaning then, that we ſhould ſo wel reliſh theſe tearms of Tyran periured, and perfidious perſon: or muſt we needs ſay of you with the Poet,</hi> Quicquid calcaueris, Roſa fiat, <hi>Whereuer you tread red Roſes grow?

me to be a fauourer of a man condemned, and excommunicated by the Church; Me, I ſay,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> a King eſtabliſhed by God, girt with a two-edged ſword, a reuenger of the wicked, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of the good, when he bids me ſend Hincmar to Rome, one that hath broken the lawes, diſgraced the Prieſthood, and wronged the Royall Dignitie; a troubler of the State, a periured perſon, a mutiner, a ſcourge of his Church, ſacrilegious, ſcandalous to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey wherein he liueth, not caring to croſſe one of his deeds with another, nor to doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to his owne hand writing: and who ſeeth not that this law was vomited out of the bottome of hell it ſelfe, &amp;c. But the holie Scriptures chalke vs out the way which we muſt walke, againſt ſuch lawes: Chriſt, the power and wiſedome of God, ſaith, By me Kings raigne, and by me Princes decree iuſt things. The holie Councels alſo ſhew what is to bee done, namely, that of Afrike, &amp;c. Likewiſe the Emperours, Valens, Gratian, Valentinian,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Iuſtinian, and others. Which lawes ought to be obſerued, not onely by other Biſhops, but alſo by the Popes themſelues: Which Leo the Pope writing to Leo the Emperour well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged: ſo did Gelaſius to Anaſtaſius, as by their words may and doth appeare. And therefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>we hold vs to that: for the Lord telleth vs by his Prophet, That the lips of the Prieſt ſhall preſerue knowledge, and men ſhall ſeeke the law at his mouth. And therefore you may not ſuffer any man in your name to write that to vs which is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained either in the holie Scriptures indited by the wiſedome of God, or at least in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Canons publiſhed by his ſpirit. For the Prophet ſaith to the Prieſt which commandeth, Thou ſhalt declare to them that which thou haſt heard of me: Of me, ſaith he, not of thy ſelfe: and they are blamed who ſpeake of their owne mind; becauſe he that ſpeaketh of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſeeketh his owne glorie. Let no man in your name write vnto vs, viſions, threats of excommunications, contrarie to the beaten way of the Scriptures, the writings of the Fathers, the ſacred Lawes and holie Canons: For you know, and ſo doe we, that whatſoeuer is repugnant to this, is void and of none effect.

And whereas the Pope gaue order, That together with <hi>Hincmar</hi> ſhould come a competent accuſer, to haue the whole cauſe reuiewed in his preſence, <hi>Although,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>this be grounded vpon no reaſon, yet if you thinke Hincmar to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſse, and if your Emperour my nephew will be content, that I ſhall paſſe through Italie to Rome, I will not faile to be there, ſo ſoone as by the grace of God I ſhall be able to ſet my realme in ſome good order againſt the Painims.

Our French Biſhops wrot much after the ſame maner, &amp; vpon the ſame argument, vnto <hi>Adrian,</hi> being aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in Synod at Douſy: wherein they call him <hi>Primae Sedis Papam;</hi> complaining, That they were vtterly miſtaken, and caſting the fault vpon his multitude of other buſineſſes, that he had not more maturely conſidered of their Acts, which were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in all points agreeing with the holie Canons.</p>
                  <p>As for the Excommunication which <hi>Adrian</hi> thundered out againſt this <hi>Charls,</hi> we could wiſh we had his owne Epiſtle in anſwer to it; but <hi>Hincmars</hi> the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Reimes we haue, who receiued command from the Pope to pronounce it, and we will here produce the principall clauſes thereof. And firſt of all, hauing complained of many grieuous reproofes and menaces receiued, he declareth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, That he had imparted the tenor of his letters to the great ones and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats of the kingdome; and which was more, had cauſed them to be openly read in an aſſemblie of Biſhops of France and Lorraine, and had ſhewed <hi>Lewis</hi> king of Germanie the aboue mentioned letter, wherein he was commaunded by <hi>Adrian,</hi>

Our Biſhops not long after met againe without the Emperour, where were great debates betweene them, becauſe of certaine Prieſts, who out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of ſundrie pariſhes had recourſe to the Popes Legats; and ſo this meeting broke vp likewiſe.

                     <hi>Photius</hi> was no ſooner ſet in his See, but preſently he called a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell at Conſtantinople: he produced certaine letters of <hi>Iohn,</hi> true or falſe, (<hi>Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſaith they were falſe and counterfeit) by which he diſannulled the former, called the eighth general Councel, held vnder <hi>Baſilius;</hi> &amp; cauſed this his Synod to beare the name of the eighth Oicumenicall Synod. And indeed this is that Councell which <hi>Zonaras,</hi> a Greeke Monke, putteth in this place, and alledgeth by this name, with all the Actions and Seſſions thereof, in his Collection of the Synods. In this Synod were preſent three Legats from Pope <hi>Iohn,</hi> namely, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> Biſhops, and <hi>Peter</hi> a Cardinall Prieſt, who were ſo trimmed by <hi>Photius,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the Acts, as neuer were Popes Legats in all their liues. Firſt it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, That there were in this Councell three hundred and eightie Biſhops, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there were onely one hundred and two in the other. Secondly, <hi>Nicholas</hi> the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> firſt and <hi>Adrian</hi> the ſecond were there condemned as Maſters of miſrule, and cauſers of all euils; and Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> for amends highly commended. Thirdly, for the Churches of Bulgaria, the Legats were put ouer to the Emperour, as being a queſtion of confines and borders of the Empire. Fourthly, it was enacted, and that by their conſents, That whomſoeuer the Pope did excommunicat, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch might not receiue, nor the Pope thoſe which were excommunicated by the Patriarch. Whereby all Appeales from thence to Rome were aboliſhed, for the purchaſing whereof Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> was content to make himſelfe a conſort with a murderous Parricide. And laſt of all, whereas the Pope had ſtraitly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:15502:115"/>
his Legats to Preſide, <hi>Photius</hi> in their preſence euer tooke his place firſt. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> this is the reaſon why <hi>Baronius</hi> ſo beſtirreth his ſtumps,<note place="margin">Idem an. <hi>879.</hi> art. <hi>72.</hi> Iohan. ad Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium Epiſt. <hi>250.</hi> Baron. an. <hi>881.</hi> art. <hi>5.</hi> &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</note> crying out, This Councell was forged by <hi>Photius,</hi> that indeed there was neuer any ſuch: Whereas yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Canons thereof, which we find in <hi>Zonaras</hi> and <hi>Balſamon,</hi> he himſelfe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth the verie ſame Acts in Greeke, taken out of their Vatican: telling vs far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, That this Councell being brought afterward to <hi>Iohn,</hi> he condemned it, and diſauowed his Legats. Well then, it appeareth that they ſuffered things to paſſe which the Pope diſliked: what other things but thoſe which are contained in thoſe Acts? Whereupon enſued freſh excommunications againſt <hi>Photius,</hi> and the rent made worſe betweene the Eaſt Churches and the Weſt.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this, Hiſtorians here obſerue, That vnder this <hi>Iohn</hi> the citie of Rome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> was diuided into two factions, one depended of the Earles of Tuſculana, who ſometimes by force, ſometimes by briberie, brought in their friends or kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to the Popedome: Whiles our French Peeres were at variance betweene themſelues, and were withall ouerlaid by the Normans, who ſo often ſet foot in France, that at laſt they tooke vp their habitation there. Hence, ſay they, enſued corruption of good diſcipline, ſimonie, and decrees of Popes croſſing and abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating each other.

But this man more ſolemnely in a Synod of ſeuentie foure Biſhops which he held at Rauenna, where demaunding euerie mans opinion ſeuerally, he cancelled the Acts of <hi>Stephen</hi> and his Synod, pardoned the Biſhops and Prieſts that gaue aſſiſtance therein, who excuſed themſelues, That what they did, they did by compulſion: forbidding that <hi>Sergius</hi> and his followers, who had digged <hi>Formoſus</hi> out of his graue, ſhould be reſtored, and condemning both them and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                  <hi>Stephen</hi> himſelfe, as violaters of ſepulchres.

This he did in fauour of <hi>Lambert,</hi> whoſe power he feared both in Italie and in Rome: by meanes whereof that law was renewed, That from thence forward the Pope ſhould not be conſecrated but in the preſence of the Embaſſadours or Lieutenants of the Emperour, contrarie

Then the Roman Biſhops, that is to ſay, the Biſhops Suffragans, Cardinals, Prieſts, Deacons, and all the people, anſwered: We maruell greatly that your ſacred wiſedome will demaund this thing of vs, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Iberians, Babylonians, nor the Indians, are ignorant of; ſo openly hee manageth his diuelliſh affaires, as no couerture or cunning he vſeth therein.

To this the whole Synod cried out, <hi>Quaſi vnus vir, as if but the voyce of one man; If this vnworthie Pope Iohn hath not committed more ſhameleſſe, and more abhominable acts than theſe that are here expreſt by Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the Deacon, we deſire holy Saint Peter the Prince of Apoſtles, neuer to abſolue vs from the ſnares of our ſinnes, who by his word ſhutteth the gates of heauen against the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie, and openeth them to the iuſt and righteous, but that we may be accurſed and ſet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> vpon the left hand at the laſt day.</hi> Neuertheleſſe the Synod requeſted the Emperor, That letters might be ſent vnto him, to come to purge himſelfe: which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſpatched, <hi>both in the name of the Emperour and the Archbiſhops;</hi> wherein briefely were expreſt the crimes whereof he was accuſed. Whereto he anſwered, directing his letters, <hi>Omnibus Epiſcopis, To all the Biſhops: We heare ſay, that yee meane to create another Pope; which if yee doe, I excommunicat yee by the omnipotent God, that yee haue no power to ordaine any, nor to celebrat the Maſſe.</hi> In the meane time that this letter was in reading, there arriued the Archbiſhop of Treuers, and other Biſhops of Lorraine, Liguria, and Aemilia, with whoſe aduiſe and counſell both the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and the Synod returned him this anſwer: <hi>If he came not, nor had any other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> lawfull cauſe to alledge (being he was neither to paſse the ſeas, nor had any bodily infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, nor yet a verie long iourney) they made light account of his excommunication, and that they would returne it vpon himſelfe, becauſe they might iuſtly doe it.

At length one <hi>Creſcentius</hi> a citizen of Rome, <hi>Otho</hi> the third being farre diſtant, dared to attempt the gouernment of the citie, the people diſtaſting a ſtrange Empire: <hi>Iohn,</hi> who loued better a Lord farre off, than neere at hand, rather forraine than domeſticall, inuiteth <hi>Otho,</hi> who was afterward the third, to come into Italie, and promiſed to crowne him Emperor: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> But <hi>Iohn</hi> dying before <hi>Otho</hi> arriued at Rome, <hi>Otho</hi> by his authoritie created at Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenna, <hi>Bruno</hi> Pope, of the houſe of Saxonie, his kinſman, then in his companie, and ſent him to be created at Rome.

But for as much as the cauſe of <hi>Arnulph</hi> Biſhop of Rhemes was not in queſtion, whether it ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> or no, it ſeemeth good to <hi>Arnulph</hi> Biſhop of Orleance, who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> directed the whole Synod, to repeat the buſineſſe at large; whoſe whole Oration it ſhall not be amiſſe in this place to inſert. <hi>We honour,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>moſt reuerend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the Church of Rome, for the memorie of S.

But two things there are which eſpecially we muſt foreſee, that is to ſay, Whether the ſilence of the Biſhop of Rome, or any new conſtitution of his, may be preiuditious to the lawes of the Canons, or the decrees of our Forefathers (he being ſilent) muſt hold their peace: And if a new conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to what end is it to make lawes, when all things are directed according to the will and arbitrement of one man? Doubtleſſe you cannot but ſee, that if you admitted either the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> one or the other, you bring the ſtate of the Church of God into danger, and ſo ſeeking lawes vpon lawes, it will come to paſſe, that we ſhall haue no lawes at all; what then, ſhal we derogat from the priuiledge of the Biſhop of Rome? no not at all. But if he be a man commendable for his learning, and of good conuerſation, we are not to feare either his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or his new conſtitutions: But if either ignorance, or feare, or couetouſneſſe, ſhal make him wander out of the way (which almoſt euen in theſe times we haue ſeene, tyrannie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing at Rome) we are a great deale the leſſe to feare either his ſilence, or his new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions. For that man that in the courſe of his life goes against the lawes, can no way be preiuditious vnto them. But ô wretched Rome, who to our forefathers haſt brought forth many excellent lights of the Church, and in our times haſt yeelded monstrous darkneſſes,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> infamous to all future ages.

And certainely euen in this holie aſſemblie there are ſome that doe affirme, That in the Low Countries, and in Germanie, neere neighbours vnto vs, there are many excellent ſeruants of God, of ſingular pietie and learning: And therefore if the courage of our iarring kings did not hinder it, we ſhould rather ſeeke to them for iudgement, than from that citie, which being put to ſale to as many as will buy, weigheth out her iudgements according to the pay.

God ſaith, If thy brother haue ſinned againſt thee, goe and reproue him, &amp;c. How then doe theſe that emulate vs ſay, That in the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Arnulph we were to expect the iudgement of the Biſhop of Rome? Can they teach vs, that the iudgement of the Biſhop of Rome is greater than the iudgement of God, when the firſt Biſhop of Rome, and the Prince of the Apoſtles, tels vs, that we must rather obey <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> God than men? yea the great Doctor of the world, Saint Paul, telleth vs, That if any man ſhall preach vnto you any other doctrine than that ye haue receiued, though he be an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell from heauen, let him be accurſed. Thinke you, that becauſe Pope Marcelline burnt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens to Idols, therefore all the Biſhops muſt doe ſo too? I dare boldly ſay, that if the Biſhop of Rome ſhall ſinne againſt his brother, and being often admoniſhed, ſhall refuſe to heare the Church, this Biſhop of Rome, I ſay, by the commaundement of God, is to be accounted as a Heathen or Publican: For by how much higher his degree is, by ſo much greater is his fall. And if he ſhall therefore account vs vnworthie his communion, or fellowſhip, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none of vs conſent vnto him againſt the Goſpell, yet he cannot therefore ſeperat vs from the Communion of Chriſt. A Prieſt if by his owne confeſsion, or otherwiſe, he be not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> conuicted, cannot be put from his office, eſpecially ſince the Apoſtle himſelfe ſaith, Who ſhal ſeperat vs from the loue of Chriſt Ieſus? And againe, Sure I am, that neither life, nor death, &amp;c. The priuiledge then of S.

At the will and pleaſure of whom the Sees were changed, Biſhoprickes giuen, and that which was horrible and deteſtable to heare, their louers, falſe Popes, were thruſt into the Seat of Peter, who were put into the Catalogue of the Popes of Rome to no other end, but to make vp the number, and lengthen the time: For who can ſay that they were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Popes of Rome, that by ſuch ſtrumpets were thruſt in without law?

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the ſonne of the Emperour <hi>Henrie</hi> the ſecond, being a child of fiue yeares of age, and brought vp vnder the tuition of <hi>Agnis</hi> his mother (as the minoritie of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces produce many times weake counſellors) was a great occaſion why <hi>Hildebrand</hi> abuſing his youth, did dare to enterpriſe ſo much: But the diuell eſpecially by his meſſengers thruſt himſelfe into the buſineſſe, whileſt they, that they might the more eaſily obtaine that they deſired, abuſed the people vnder the name of two pretended Hereſies: the one was Simonie, the ſale for ſiluer, or other thing equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolent thereunto, of Eccleſiaſtical charges, though at that time there was nothing at Rome more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, where the Popedome it ſelfe was ſet to ſale to whomſoeuer would giue moſt, where the Popes ſold all Eccleſiaſtical dignities, and themſelues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to the diuell, as we haue often ſeene, Simons and Magitians together: But they made the ſignification of this word Simonie, to extend verie far, including with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of that ſinne, the Princes, who joyned their authoritie in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the people and Clergie, and inueſted Biſhops into their dignitie; whom they likewiſe held to be heretikes, becauſe they had receiued their inueſtiture from Princes: thereby ſtirring vp the ill humors of both States, the people to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure againſt their Biſhops, the Nobles to rebell againſt their Princes. The other was the Hereſie of the Nicholaits, directly (whether by errour or ſubtiltie) againſt the truth of the hiſtorie of <hi>Nicholas,</hi> who being a Deacon in the Primitiue Church was therefore reprehended, becauſe vnder a colour of continencie he forſooke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> his wife, and afterwards betooke himſelfe to a more licentious and vncleane life, as we haue elſewhere ſhewed out of <hi>Epiphanius.</hi> But of that ſinne there were none more guiltie than the Roman Clergie, the Popes themſelues of the precedent world frequenting common brothel-houſes at Rome, as we haue ſeene. But they wreſting it otherwiſe, will haue vs to vnderſtand and include vnder the name of Nicholaits, thoſe Biſhops and Prieſts, who according to the law of God, and rule of the Apoſtles, and cuſtome of the Primatiue Church, and Decrees of the firſt generall Nicene Councell, and diuers others, doe allow of lawfull mariage, and liue with thoſe women whom they haue maried in the face of the Church. Both the one and the other was the inuention of <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> or rather of his maſter, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> who ſometimes by the one, ſometimes by the other, bewitched the people, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Princes, traduced the Biſhops.

               <p>Neither were the definements of the Popes leſſe furthered in theſe times, vnder the colour of the Nicholaits.

The tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult neuertheleſſe being pacified, beginning his Sermon with the Supremacie of the Church of Rome, and the abſolute power thereof, he told them, That all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches were ordained of men, but the Church of Rome onely had her foundation from God himſelfe: and therefore from her all other, but eſpecially the Church of Milan, had taken their firſt beginning and rudiments of diſcipline, to which likewiſe and to the Biſhop thereof it was neceſſarie to be ſubiect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> at his pleaſure the heauens themſelues were opened and ſhut; and therfore he that ſhould derogat any thing from his priuiledge, ſhould preſently be cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for an Heretike.

Here, ſaith the Author,<note place="margin">Abbas Vrsperg. in Chronico.</note> 
                  <hi>in this thing we are to conſider the Prelats authoritie, and the Popes humilitie, whileſt the one contended to defend the dignitie of his office, the other, though his dignitie were greater, yet thought it fit to yeeld to a Metropolitan in his owne Dioceſſe.</hi>

Haue we euer read that Gregorie euer did this, or by his letters taught it, who endured ſo many wrongs and violences by the raging crueltie of the Lombards? Did Ambroſe make warre againſt the Arrians, who cruelly vexed him and his Church? Or haue we read of any of the holie Popes that haue riſen vp in armes?

But did he make warre with his owne powers? Did he proclaime warres? Did he goe into the field in his owne perſon? He replieth, Neither did Pope <hi>Leo</hi> fight, but was onely preſent at the warres, and when they came to joyne battell he withdrew himſelfe out of the field, where with ſafetie he might attend the euent: and ſo of this his Monarch he maketh a Trumpeter, or an inciter vnto warre. Here let the Reader note this mans impudencie, who fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not to accuſe <hi>Damian</hi> of the hereſie of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who diſſuaded Chriſtians from warre; or rather of <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apoſtata, who commaunded Chriſtians, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Goſpell, to ſuffer all manner of wrong and violence, without reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Is therefore the vocation of all Chriſtians one and the ſame?

He is an Apostat Monke, who by his new opinions adulterateth the ſacred diuinitie, the Scriptures by his falſe and forced interpretations he accommodates to his owne affaires and purpoſes, he breakes the peace and concord of the Colledge, he mingleth things ſacred with prophane, diuine with humane, and polluteth both the one and the other, he lendeth an eare, and giues credit to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the diabolicall, and impure and falſe accuſations of our deadlieſt enemies, to the maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of wicked men.

Inſomuch that the Hiſtoriographers of thoſe times want words to expreſſe the horror and abomination of that diſordered confuſion, <hi>which by all good men was imputed to Gregorie,</hi> who crie out againſt this vnworthie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and wicked act, <hi>in their ſermons curſe Gregorie, wiſh all ill to Hildebrand, publiſh him to be Antechriſt: vnder a ſhew of pietie</hi> (ſay they) <hi>he exerciſeth his furies, with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest words he makes ſhew of ſeeking the publike good, vnder the title of Christ, he playes the part of Antechrist, in Babylon he ſits in the Temple of God, and extolleth himſelfe aboue all that is worſhipped, as if he were God: he glorieth that he cannot erre, and for the greater increaſe of his glorie, he takes vpon him to make an Emperor at his pleaſure: he abſolues men not of their ſinnes, but the Law of Christ Ieſus and his Sacraments, he weakneth the peace and pietie of our Religion, stirres vp warres and ſeditions: He giues himſelfe to whoredome, murder, periurie, treacheries, rapines, burnings: And the better to hide his ambition, he doth not onely find out new fables, corrupt the Anna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> alter the Histories, but he likewiſe adulterateth the heauenlie Oracles, giues falſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of the Scriptures, making them to ſerue his turne, he teares in pieces the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Hiſtorie, and amongſt women diſcourſeth of holie writ: whatſoeuer he ſaith, he will haue it to be thought the Law of God: he ſeekes teſtimonies that are too weake to defend his auarice, and wreſts the Scriptures to his owne will againſt the true ſence. He ſauours too much of the pride of the Phariſies, in that he makes men beleeue, that he bindes and looſseth as he pleaſeth, whereas with God it is not the ſentence of the Prieſt, but the life of the man that is required. Moreouer Hildebrand oppugneth the Diuine maieſtie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth the moſt Chriſtian Prince, ordayned from aboue, and inaugurated by God himſelfe. To this end tend all his endeauours, that the captaine of the flocke being oppreſſed, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> brought into order, he might the more freely exerciſe his tyrannie againſt the poore ſheepe destitute of the Emperours protection. If all power be of God, much more the imperiall, and greateſt of all other. Chriſt Ieſus, when the people would haue crowned him, and made him gouernour, refuſed it, and thoſe two that were at variance for the inheritance, and would haue choſen him for their Iudge, he ſent to Caeſar to whom the Empire of the whole world was committed. So likewiſe he commaunded the chiefe Prieſts of the Iewes to giue vnto Caeſar thoſe things that did belong vnto Caeſar, to whom they payed their cuſtomes, their tribute, their ſubſidies. S.

In the meane time whileſt he depoſed the Emperour vnder a pretence of Simonie, he had no ſooner depriued thoſe Biſhops, of whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, of their authoritie, but he reſtored it to them againe, thereby binding them vnto him, and againſt the Emperour. In honour of Pope <hi>Liberius,</hi> who was an Arrian, he ordained a Feaſt, and committed many outrages beſides, againſt all law and equitie, murders, oppreſſions, violences, which it would be too long to relate.

We haue no need to be taught af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what manner Peter and his Collegues vſed the Spirituall power, or to ſpeake more truely the diſpenſation and procuration of the heauenlie food, for we are the Butlers, as it were, and Yeomen of Gods garner. It plainely appeareth in the booke of the Acts of the Apoſtles, written by Saint Luke the Phyſitian, that the armour of our warfare is the ſpirit, not ſword, nor rapine, nor murders, nor periuries; but our breaſtplate, or helmet, girdle, ſword, buckler, are peace, loue, righteouſneſſe, hope, truth, the word of God, faith: all which our moſt Christian Emperour hath many times of his free will offered to Hilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand, but he hath refuſed them.

I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that this is a great ſinne, but yet humane, and ſuch as many, yea good men, haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten committed. And if we truely conſider of this our Prince, we ſhall find, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer vices there are in him, either by naturall inclination, or by reaſon of his age, they are ouer counterpoyſed by his excellent vertues, his readineſſe in the execution of great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, his fortitude in the middeſt of dangers, his incredible courage, patience in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, counſell anſwerable to his magnanimitie, and his diligence, as farre forth as his age is capable, in militarie affaires; his knowledge of diuine and humane lawes, an euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting deſire of peace, care of religion, bountie towards the poore, clemencie towards the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> vanquiſhed, benignitie towards his friends, beneuolence towards ſouldiers, in all which he hath excelled all the German and Roman Princes that euer were. And if he had beene a wicked tyran, yet it had beene our dueties to haue obeyed him, not to rebell againſt him: and all humane lawes, and the decrees of our forefathers, doe forbid a mans aduerſaries, his enemies to be his accuſers, witneſſes, and Iudges. The Emperour made peace with Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debrand in Italie, whileſt, by the perfidious treacherie of a few, Saxonie fell from him: A traiterous tyran, who receiued due puniſhment for his treacherie, contemning all oathes and promiſes, and all affinitie and kindred, inuaded him.</hi> At the laſt he concludeth: <hi>No man may proceed or pronounce ſentence againſt a man that is depriued, vntill he be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to his former eſtate: See the booke and read the law;</hi> and ſo he deliuered it to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

From that time forward many of the Biſhops and Princes of Saxonie abiure the ſect of <hi>Hildebrand</hi> (that name they retained in the time of <hi>Vrban</hi>) and repenting themſelues of what they had done, came to the Emperour: Onely foureteene perſiſt obſtinat therein, who being aſſigned to appeare the moneth following at Mence, at their day of appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance came not. There the reſt of the Biſhops of Germanie being preſent, with the Legats of the Biſhops of France and Italie, by the common conſent of all, the ſect of <hi>Hildebrand</hi> is judged to be contrarie to Chriſtian pietie. <hi>Otho</hi> (called <hi>Vrban</hi>)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> being conuicted of ſacriledge and irreligion, was excommunicated, and thoſe foureteene being condemned of rebellion, periurie, murder, were depoſed.

To the ſame remedies they had euer recourſe, conſecrating their children, if they had any, to the ſelfeſame warres, and giuing ſuch goods as they had to expiat their ſinnes. On the otherſide euerie vnskilfull ſouldier carried with a feruent deſire of this warre, fell vpon the Iewes, againſt whom they had libertie, as they thought, to offer any violence, and if they did not preſently turne Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,

Our Biſhoppe communicateth with his King and Emperour, to whom for thoſe Royalties he holds from him, hee hath ſworne fidelitie: It is a long time ſince this cuſtome began, and vnder the ſame many holie and reuerend Biſhoppes haue departed this world, giuing vnto Caeſar, that which belongs vnto Caeſar, and vnto God thoſe things that are Gods.</hi> And here they produce many places out of <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine. Now behold,</hi> ſaith the Church of Liege, <hi>why wee are held for excommunicats, euen becauſe wee hold and to our vttermost <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> power doe imitate the holie and moderate auntient Fathers. We hold with our Biſhop and Archbiſhoppe, our prouinciall and conprouinciall Synod, according to the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient tradition, and whatſoeuer is there determined by the holie Scriptures; we goe not to Rome but for ſuch matters as are not determined by the Scriptures. And as for thoſe Legats</hi> a Latere, <hi>who runne through the world to fill their purſes, wee wholly reiect them, according to thoſe Councels of Africa, held in the times of Zozimus, Caeleſtnius, and Boniface: For, that we may know them by their fruites, there proceeds from their Legations no correction of manners, or amendement of life, but the ſlaughters of men, and the ſpoyle of the Church of God. Foraſmuch therefore as we sticke to the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient rule, &amp; are not caried with euerie wind of doctrine, we are called excommunicats,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> falſe Clerkes &amp;c.

Paule the Apoſtle reſiſteth Peter the Prince of the Apoſtles to his face, and therefore laying aſide the wind of the Roman ambition, why ſhould not the Biſhops of Rome be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and corrected for great and manifeſt offences: He that refuſeth to be corrected is a falſe Biſhop, a falſe Clerke; but we who by the mercie of God are obedient and corri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> according to the rule, by the aſſiſtance of Gods ſpirit will auoyd Schiſmes, and ſimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie and excommunications in all things &amp;c.

When Alaricus King of the Gothes went to take Rome, being admoniſhed by one of the ſeruants of God, to deſiſt from ſo wicked an enterpriſe, I goe not willingly (ſaith he) to Rome, but a certaine man doth daily vrge me to deſtroy it. By this example doth the Pope vrge his Eſquire to waſt and ouerrunne the whole kingdome, which cannot be done without ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and bloud, and the ruine of the Church of God. Alaricus was more mild, who hauing

                  </note> he held a Councell at Lateran in the yeare 1139, where aſſembled all nations of the Weſt, neere to a thouſand Biſhops and Abbots: and in this mightie multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude notwithſtanding, we read of nothing that was there propounded, or deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, touching the reformation of the Church, either in doctrine or diſcipline, though it was manifeſtly moſt corrupt, both before and at this preſent; which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> bewailed, with the hope of a better ſtate. This Councell therefore had no other end but to eſtabliſh <hi>Innocent,</hi> and condemne the fauourers of <hi>Anaclet,</hi> vnleſſe they would performe the penance they were appointed; to weaken the ordinances made by him, or by thoſe whom he had ordained. And here let the Reader judge what ſcruples they left in the conſciences of ſo many and diuers nations, when both <hi>Anaclet</hi> and the ordinances made by him almoſt for the ſpace of eight yeres, were farre the better. <hi>Roger,</hi> remaining Duke of Apulia, and Calabria, and naming himſelfe King of Sicilia, theſe good Fathers reſolued alſo to ſuppreſſe and bring into order. <hi>Innocent</hi> therefore hauing prepared an armie of the Romans, he in his owne perſon intended to lead them againſt him, yet had hee the ſame ſucceſſe as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſometimes had <hi>Leo</hi> the ninth: for <hi>Roger</hi> retiring himſelfe to the caſtle of Gallutz, he verie ſharpely beſieged it; but <hi>William</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Roger</hi> Prince of Tarent, comming with a valiant companie of ſouldiers, put the Popes armie to flight, tooke him with all his Cardinals, and carried him to Naples: But he was ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie not long after vpon two conditions, that is, To abſolue <hi>Roger</hi> of the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, and to declare him King of Sicilia, Duke of Apulia, and Calabria, and Prince of Capua, and a liege man of the Church, which <hi>Anaclet</hi> before had done. And in this manner the Popes naturally regard not any but themſelues, thinking all others, how great ſoeuer, to be borne to doe them ſeruice: In the

But becauſe this motion had his progreſsions, it were fit we ſhould further diſcourſe thereon: neither is it in the mean time to be forgotten, that we make it appeare, how by diuers degrees <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> their pride roſe alwayes againſt God, and not onely againſt men.

Thy ſheepe, what deſire they? Theſe paſtures (if I durſt ſo ſpeake) rather of Diuels than of ſheepe: Thinke you S. Peter did thus, or S. Paule played thus? Thou ſeeſt that all Eccleſiaſticall zeale is feruent for the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping onely of dignitie: All is giuen to honour, little or nothing to ſanctitie. If, the cauſe ſo requiring, you endeauor to beare yourſelfe a little more humble and ſociable: Far be it (ſay they) it becommeth not, it fitteth not the time, it agreeth not with Maiestie, conſider what perſon thou beareſt.

The feare of the Lord is counted ſimplicitie, that I ſay not, fooliſhneſſe: What then wilt thou doe &amp;c?

In theſe things, thou haſt ſucceeded not Peter, but Conſtantine. Though thou goe in purple, and gold, yet thou ſhouldeſt not neglect thy Paſtorall worke or charge, thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt not be aſhamed of the Goſpell. Howbeit, if willingly thou preach the Goſpell, thou haſt glorie among the Apoſtles.

It little wanted then, but that the tares choked the good corne, when with them little or no mention is made of juſtifying by faith, the fortreſſe of ſaluation is thenceforth placed in dead workes; as if Chriſtian doctrine, that moſt profound ſecret, hidden before all time, and reuealed in his time, were nothing but a certaine morall diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. In the ſame time alſo <hi>Gratian</hi> compiled his Decrees, not more fortunatly than <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> his Pandectes, out of the Canons and auncient Decrees, which hee in many places applieth to the abuſes of the time, and eſpecially to the Roman <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ambition, although he leaue vs therein many good footſteps, by helpe of which the diligent ſearchers may find out the ancient doctrine &amp; practiſe of the Church.</p>

The particular clauſes are:</hi> By occaſion of the word <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficium</hi> thy heart (as I am informed) hath beene moued, which truely ought not to moue the heart of an inferiour, nor yet of ſo great a man: For although the word <hi>Beneficium</hi> be taken by ſome in another ſignification, yet it ſhould then haue beene taken as we meant it, and in the ſence it hath from his original; for it is compoſed of <hi>bonum &amp; factum,</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> with vs we call <hi>beneficium, non feudum,</hi> not a fee, but <hi>bonum factum,</hi> a good action, in which ſence it is found in all the bodie of holie Scripture, where it is read, That we are gouerned and nouriſhed, <hi>ex beneficio Dei,</hi> by the benefits of God, <hi>non tanquam ex feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> not as by a fee, but by his bleſsing. And ſo your magnificence knoweth, that wee haue ſo honourably ſet the ſigne of Imperiall dignitie on your head, that all men may iudge it to be, <hi>vt bonum factum,</hi> as a good deed, or a good action. <hi>And thus corrected he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his former letters, but alſo the inſcription of the picture of</hi> Innocent <hi>the ſecond,</hi> Poſt homo fit Papae, He was made the Popes vaſsall. <hi>He proceedeth:</hi> Some haue alſo tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned theſe words to another ſence, <hi>Contulimus tibi inſigne Imperialis Coronae,</hi> Wee haue giuen thee the ſigne of Imperiall dignitie (<hi>he had ſaid more harſhly,</hi> plenitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> dignitatis, the fulneſſe of dignitie, <hi>that is to ſay, the whole dignitie</hi>) but without cauſe, and of ſet purpoſe, becauſe they loue not the peace of the Kingdom and of the Church; for by this word <hi>contulimus,</hi> we vnderſtand nothing but <hi>impoſuimus,</hi> wee haue ſet it vpon thy head.<note place="margin">Radeuicus l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>13.</hi>

When ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> we conferred together often of many things, as the manner is betweene friends, hee diligently and familiarly inquired of me, what opinion men had of him, and of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, I plainely layed open vnto him with libertie of ſpeech, the euill words I had heard in diuers Prouinces: For thus it is ſayd: The Church of Rome, which is mother of all Churches, behaueth herſelfe, towards others, not as a mother, but as a ſtepdame: The Scribes and Pharaſes ſit in the ſame, lading mens ſhoulders with burthens, heauie to be borne, which they themſelues touch not with a finger: They haue dominion ouer the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, and yet are not an example to the flocke, leading the right way to life: They heape vp pretious moueables, load their Tables with gold and ſiluer, beeing ſparing to themſelues through ouermuch couetouſneſſe: For the poore, they are neuer, or verie ſeldome receiued, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and then not ſo much for the loue of Chriſt as for vayne glorie: By force of terrour they wreſt from the Churches, the ſtir vp contentions, incite the Clergie and people the one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other, haue no compaſſion of the paynes &amp; miſeries of the afflicted, they delight in the ſpoyles of Churches, and doe all account gayne for godlineſse: They do iuſtice, not for the truths ſake, but for gaine: All things to day are done for money, but tomorrow thou ſhalt obtayne nothing without reward: They often hurt, wherein they imitate Diuels, and they are thought then to doe good, when they ceaſe from hurting, ſome few excepted, who fulfill the name and office of Paſtour: Yea the Pope of Rome himſelfe is burthenous to all, and almoſt intollerable: Moreouer we ſee that although the Churches, which the deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Fathers haue builded, goe to ruine, and altars to be without ornament, yet in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the meane time he buildeth for himſelfe Palaces, and goeth not onely in purple, but all coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ouer with gold: The Palaces of Churchmen glitter in beautie, but in their hands the Church of Chriſt is foule and without furniture: They take by violence the ſpoyles of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, as if they purpoſed to repaire the treaſuries of Craeſus: But the most high handleth them well, giuing them as a prey vnto others, and often vnto moſt vile perſons, and (as I thinke) whiles they wander out of the way, the ſcourge of God will not depart from them for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it, that with what iudgement they iudge they ſhall be iudged, and their owne meaſure ſhall be meaſured to them againe: This is it (ſay I) ô Father which the people ſay, ſeeing you will haue me ſhew you their opinions. <hi>And ſurely he ſufficiently alſo declared thereby his owne opinion, when he ſayd</hi> as I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> thinke: <hi>But</hi> Adrian <hi>putteth him vpon the racke:</hi> And thou, ſaith he, what is thine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion? I am in a ſtrait euerie way (ſayd I) for I feare I ſhall incurre the blame of lying and flatterie, if I alone doe contradict the people, and if otherwiſe I feare to be accuſed of high treaſon, and be thought to deſerue the gibbet, for opening my mouth againſt heauen: Yet ſeeing that Guido Clemens Priest, Cardinall of S. Potenciana, witneſteth vnto the people, I preſume not in any ſort to contradict him; for he ſaith, that in the Church of Rome there is a certaine root <hi>duplicitatis</hi> of doubleneſſe, <hi>which is contrarie to the</hi> ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of a Doue, <hi>which is ſo much commended to Chriſtians:</hi> A nouriſhing alſo of all couetouſneſſe, which is the head and root of all euils. And this he publiquely proteſted,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:15502:179"/>
not in a corner, but to the Cardinalls his brethren ſitting in Conſistorie, before Eugenius,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> when the Ferentines were hot againſt my innocencie. Yet, I boldly ſay, my conſcience bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring me witneſſe, that I haue now here ſeene more honeſt Clergie men than in the Church of Rome. <hi>And here he nameth vnto him</hi> Bernard <hi>of Redon, Cardinall Deacon, and the Biſhop of Preneſt; without doubt, that he might prepare a way to that which he had to ſay.</hi> Becauſe therefore that you inſtantly vrge and commaund me, and that it is not lawfull to lye vnto the holie Ghoſt, I confeſſe what you command muſt be done, and yet all are not to imitate you in all workes; for he which diſſenteth from the true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is either an heretike or a ſchiſmatike: but through Gods mercie there bee ſome which imitate not the workes of all of vs, &amp;c. But I feare leaſt in continuing to enquire of me what you will, you heare of an imprudent friend that which you would not. What is this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Father, that thou examineſt the life of others, and doeſt in no wiſe ſearch into thy ſelfe? All men applaud thee, all men call thee Lord and Father, and the whole oyle of a ſinner is poured on thy head. If then thou art a Father, why doeſt thou expect gifts and retributions from thy children? If a Lord, why ſtrikeſt thou not a feare in thy Romans? and repreſsing their temeritie, why doeſt thou not call them backe to the faith? <hi>For he had ſaid a little before, That God tooke away godlie men from Rome,</hi> becauſe being corrupt, it was found with God vnworthie of ſuch men. But thou wilt preſerue the Citie to the Church by thy gifts; did Silueſter obtaine it by gifts? <hi>In inuio Pater es, non in via,</hi> Father thou art out of the way, and not in the way: It is to be preſerued by the ſame gifts whereby it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> was gotten. That which you haue receiued freely giue freely: Iuſtice is the Queene of all vertues, and bluſheth to be changed for any price whatſoeuer: for to be gracious it must be freely beſtowed. Let not her by any meanes be proſtituted to price of money, which cannot be corrupted. Iuſtice is entire, and euer vncorrupt. In oppreſsing others thou ſhalt be more grieuouſly oppreſsed. The Pope, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> laugheth at it, and congratulateth my libertie. <hi>But what ſaith the Pope to this? ſurely he telleth him that fable of</hi> Aeſop, <hi>of the members of one that ſometime mutined againſt the ſtomacke, for it receiued all and did nothing; and when they had determined to ſend no more any thing into it, after ſome few dayes the whole bodie pined away: thereupon concluding, that euen ſo would it be with all Chriſtendome, if from all parts they ſent not riches to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Rome.

Hardly truely wilt thou aduenture thy ſoule for him, for whom thou haſt not dained to ſpeake or write one word; and now three times we haue beene promiſed Legats, and yet they are not ſent, that, to ſay <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the truth, I may thinke them rather</hi> Ligati <hi>than</hi> Legati, <hi>bound that they ſhall not come, than appoynted to come. If my ſonne were in proſperitie they had come with all poſsible ſpeed, becauſe out of his great bountie, and the publicke profit they make of the kingdome, they expected plentifull rewards of their Legations. And what greater glorie can there be, than to ſet free a captiue King, to bring peace to the people, ſafetie to the religious, and ioy and comfort to euerie one? But now they faile at a pinch. The Wolfe holdeth his prey, and the dogges either cannot or will not barke. Is this the promiſe which you made vnto vs at the caſtle of Radolphus, with ſo much proteſtation of loue and fidelitie? What can it profit you to deceiue ſimple people, and by a vaine confidence to mocke the prayers of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent?

The time foretold by the Apoſtle is euen at hand, a time of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting, of Apoſtacie and reuolt, that the ſonne of perdition may be reuealed: Now begins the perillous times, that the vnſeamed coat of Chriſt may be cut aſunder, that S.

Theſe are thoſe who burthen their clients with ſuperfluous charge, being prodigall of another mans purſe, and ſparing of their own; lying in wait to catch men in their words, hunt after ſillables, and lay ſnares to get money: They interpret the law at their owne will and pleaſure, and according to their owne wills they admit them or diſallow them.

But worſe followeth, <hi>Becauſe he was like vnto Chriſt, he was aptly named Dominicus, by our Lord Chriſt; for Dominicus,</hi> quaſi totus Domini, <hi>was that principally and by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> poſſeſsion, which our Lord was abſolutely and by authoritie:</hi> For the Lord ſaith, <hi>I am the light of the world, and the Church ſingeth of Dominick, Yee are the light of the world. The Prophets diuers wayes foretold of our Lord, for they all beare witneſſe of him. Of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minick and his Order ſaith Zacharie in his eleuenth Chapter, ſpeaking of the perſon of God, I haue taken vnto me two ſtaues, the one I haue called</hi> Decorem, <hi>Beautie; the other</hi> Funiculum, <hi>a Cord or a Band: Beautie is the Order of S.

Furthermore, <hi>The Lord was borne vpon the naked earth, but the Virgine his mother, for feare of the cold, puts him into a manger; Dominick being borne, and a little infant vnder the cuſtodie of his nurſe, getting out of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> his cradle, deteſting as it were the delights of the fleſh, was found oftentimes by his nurſe lying all naked vpon the bare earth.

The prayer of the Lord was euer heard whenſoeuer he wold, for, that which he prayed for in the garden, That the cup might be taken from him, was not gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, becauſe he praying according to the fleſh, he would not obtaine according to reaſon: but Dominick neuer demaunded any thing of God, which he fully obtained not according to his deſire:</hi> that is to ſay,<note place="margin">Ibidem para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra. <hi>2.</hi>

But when theſe conferences did little ſatisfie the Lords, and that the people were nothing moued at the preaching of <hi>Dominicus,</hi> whom the Pope (hauing beene, as he ſayd, warned in a dreame) had choſen to vphold his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of Lateran that otherwiſe was readie to fall to ruine; he hath recourſe to other counſels, which theſe fore-proceedings did but colour, for forme ſake.

So that, ſuch was the furie or ignorance of that age, he incited many Princes, Lords, and Prelats to aſſemble themſelues on all parts, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſet vpon them; who might better cheape and eaſier expiate their vices, with the dammage of this people, than by fighting againſt the Saracens in the holie land. At their comming, with the fright of this deluge, Earle <hi>Raymund</hi> is aſtoniſhed, and promiſeth obedience to the Church of Rome. But (marke here the manner) <hi>Almarick</hi> the Popes Legat, Generall of this armie, draggeth him into the Church by a ſtole caſt about his necke, and with ſcourgings. From thence the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are laid waſt, Townes are ſacked, and all places filled with ſlaughters, fire, and ruine; neuertheleſſe the Albigenſes courage fayled not vtterly, but many times renewed the warre.

Meane time, it is here to be noted, that although this warre was made in Fraunce, yet King <hi>Philip Auguſtus</hi> was not the head thereof, but the Pope and his Legat, who made it his owne conqueſt that was woon in this warre. The King onely ſuffered his ſubjects to enrol themſelues for the Popes wars, and the Lords of the Kingdome to lead troupes of ſouldiers thither.<note place="margin">

With like faith and deuotion <hi>Gregorie</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted againſt him the money that he had exacted throughout all Chriſtendome, namely in Germanie, France, and England, vnder colour for the Holie Land: and the Friers Preachers and Minors had none other theame of their ſermons but this, That there was greater merit in ruinating <hi>Frederick</hi> and his, than in exterminating <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the Saracens, than whom they were farre worſe.

And if he were to be depoſed for his demerits, yet he could not be iudged but by a generall Councell. Of his faults his enemies ought not to be beleeued, of which number the Pope was knowne to be the chiefe. For our parts, hee hath beene vnto vs hitherto innocent, yea rather a good neighbour, neither haue we ſeene any hurtfull thing in him, in ſecular faithfulneſſe, nor in the Catholike faith. Wee know that he hath faithfully made warre for our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, valiantly expoſed himſelfe to the dangers of the ſea, and of battels. We haue not found ſo much religion in the Pope; but contrariwiſe he which ought to haue aduanced and protected him, fighting the battels of God, hath endeuoured wickedly in his abſence to ruinat and ſupplant him. The prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> effuſion of our bloud againſt him the Romans little regard, ſo they may ſatisfie their wrath. And when he ſhall haue by vs or others ouercome him, he will trample vnder feet all the Princes of the world, and lift vp his hornes of boaſting and pride, becauſe he hath oppreſſed Frederick a great Emperour. But leaſt wee ſhould ſeeme to haue receiued the Popes meſſage in vayne, though it he apparent to vs, that the Church of Rome hath not done it for loue of vs, but for hatred of the Emperour, we will ſend prudent embaſſadours vnto him, which may diligently enquire of his faith, and certifie vs of it, and if they find nothing but ſound and good, wherefore ſhould we moleſt him? But if he or any other, bee it the Pope himſelfe, ſhould hold an euill opinion concerning God, we will perſecute him to the death: which the Popes embaſſadours hearing, departed confounded. There went <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> then ſolemne French embaſſadours to the Emperour, who rehearſed to him from poynt to poynt that which they had heard from the Pope: Which when the Emperour vnderſtood, he was aſtoniſhed at ſo vnmeaſurable an hatred, and anſwered, I am a Catholike Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, rightly beleeuing all the articles of the Orthodoxall faith, my Lord Ieſus Chriſt forbid that I ſhould euer depart from the faith of my noble fathers, and predeceſſors, for to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſteps of vile caſt-awayes. The Lord iudge betweene me and him, who hath ſo wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly defamed me through the world; and lifting vp his hands vnto heauen, with teares and ſighes he cried out, The Lord God of reuenges render vnto him his reward.</hi> Thus writeth the Monke <hi>Mathew Paris,</hi> an Engliſh Chronicler.

               <p>It is not in the mean time to be forgotten, that the Popes to colour their affaires the better, had euer ſounding in their mouthes the holie land, that when vnder <hi>Honorius</hi> the third king <hi>Iohn</hi> of Brenna had taken the famous citie of Damieta, Cardinall <hi>Pelagius</hi> the Popes Legat pretended that he was to haue the chief com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund ouer the armie; whereat the king incenſed, retired himſelfe through de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite to <hi>Ptolomais,</hi> whereby were loſt the beſt opportunities to doe good, and in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the end after many bad ſucceſſes, Damieta was forſaken.

Therefore hauing aſſembled a Parliament, he began to ſet downe a moſt excellent order for the well gouerning of the realme, and for the reforming of juſtice: But <hi>the diuell</hi> (ſaith <hi>Mathew Paris) enemie of mankind, diſturber of peace, and raiſer vp of ſchiſmes, vnhappily hindered all that, by the Popes couetouſneſſe: For the Pope beleeuing that the flexible Engliſh had alreadie ſubmitted their neckes to the ſayd contribution, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their cuſtome, as well by reaſon of the kings deſire thereto, as for the inſtance of his requeſt, ſent</hi> à Latere ſuo <hi>one maſter Martin, his Clerke, whom many for his wicked <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> rauening called maſter Maſtife, hauing a new and vnheard of power, greater than euer any Legat had before him. For he ſtretched forth his hands to exact contribution, made prouiſions, after his owne fantaſie, voyd of reaſon,</hi> ad opus ignotorum, <hi>for to ſupply the need of vnknowne perſons, and violently tooke away the reuenues for to giue them to the Popes kindred, being cruelly armed with the Popes authoritie, whoſe Bulls he daily ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, new at his pleaſure, and according as the buſineſſe on euery ſudden occaſion fell out. Whence it came, that ſome ſaid he had many papers vnwritten, yet ſealed, that he might write in them what he pleaſed, which farre be it.</hi> But <hi>Iſte Legatus ſophiſticus, That ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſticall Legat commeth to the king, beſeeching him, That he himſelfe would diligently labour in the Popes behalfe, that the Prelats of England might generally giue conſent to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> make contribution to the Pope, of at leaſt ten thouſand markes.</hi> The king anſwereth, That his Barons and Prelats are ſo often ſpoyled of their goods vnder diuers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, that they neither would nor could thenceforth promiſe any thing, <hi>They will not, neither are they able to contribute either to me their king, or to the Pope,</hi> who yet haue promiſed to aid me.

In the yere fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, are made new admoniſhments to the Pope and Cardinals, by the letters of the king, States and Prelats of the kingdome, whereby were repreſented vnto them innumerable grieuances, the articles of which are rehearſed by the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. Theſe among others were new, that the Pope by his letters enjoyned the Prelats, that they ſhould euerie man at their owne proper charges, furniſh forth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> one man fiue, another tenne, and another fifteene &amp;c. men of warre well horſed and armed, for to doe him ſeruice whereſoeuer he ſhould commaund; to whom they ſhould giue a yeares pay; which is a militarie ſeruice due to the king alone, and from which neuertheleſſe they might be diſpenſed for money. Alſo, that, to the end the king might not hinder it, the Popes Nuncios fraudulently had forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the Prelats, vnder paine of excommunication, that they ſhould not reueale this exaction to any in ſixe moneths. <hi>Innocent</hi> then was ſo farre off from reuoking them, that in deſpite of the king he made a new ſtatute in England, <hi>That the goods of ſuch as died inteſtate ſhould be conuerted to his vſe, and appointed the Preaching Friers diligently to put the ſame in execution.</hi> Which the king hauing intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of, expreſly forbiddeth, <hi>deteſting,</hi> Romanae curiae augmentoſam, multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem, ac multiformem auaritiam, <hi>the augmenting, multiplying and euerie way mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold couetuouſneſſe of the Court of Rome:</hi> He alſo forbiddeth thenceforth to pay tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the Pope; whereat the Pope being greatly moued, reſolueth to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municat the king and kingdome. Hereupon Cardinall <hi>Iohn</hi> an Engliſhman, a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtertian Monke, ſaith vnto him; <hi>For Gods ſake, my Lord, refraine your anger, which is (if I may ſo ſpeake) vndiſcreet; and with temperance bridle the paſſions of your will, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that the dayes are euill; The holie land lieth open to daunger, the Greeke church is departed from vs, Frederic is our aduerſarie, then whom none, among the Chriſtian Princes, is mightier, or yet like vnto him: You and we which are the higheſt of the church <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> are baniſhed from the Papall ſeat, yea from the Citie it ſelfe, yea from Italie; Hungarie, and the adiacent prouinces, expect nothing but vtter ruin from the Tartarians; Germanie is ſhaken with ciuile warres; Spaine is growne to that crueltie as to cut off the tongues of Biſhops; Fraunce is by vs alreadie brought to pouertie, and hath conſpired againſt vs; and England ſo oftentimes hurt by our iniuries, as Balaams aſſe ſpurred and beaten with a ſtaffe, at laſt ſpeaketh and ſpeaketh againſt, and complaineth that ſhee is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much and intollerably wearied, and vnreſtoreably damnified. After the manner of Iſmael, beeing hatefull to all, wee procure all men to hate vs; And when for all that, the Popes mind was not appeaſed, nor inclined to compaſſion or humilitie, but
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:15502:209"/>
was inflamed to puniſhment and reuenge, there came meſſengers from England, who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> mitigated the Popes mind gaping after profit, aſſuring him, that by his most ſpeciall friends in England the kings heart was bowed, ſo that he remitted it to the Clergie to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his wiſh, the ioy whereof wonderfully calmed his mind and countenance.</hi> Yet whilſt he waited and expected the ſame, taking boldneſſe of this hope, he commandeth the Prelats of England, <hi>ſolito imperioſius, more imperiouſly than he was woont,</hi> That they ſhould cauſe to be paid him from all beneficed perſons reſident, the third part of their reuenues, and by nonreſidents the one halfe, with this deteſtable clauſe, <hi>Non obſtante, &amp;c. which aboliſheth all iuſtice.</hi> And for to vrge theſe exactions are ſent <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> Friers Minorites, <hi>who armed with Bulls from the Pope, and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vnder ſheepes clothing their woluiſh rauening, preſented themſelues to the king, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> with a ſimple looke, humble countenance, and fawning ſpeech, entreated leaue of the king to wander throughout the Realme,</hi> ad opus Domini Papae charitatem petituri, <hi>to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund a charitie for the need of the Pope, promiſing that they would doe nothing by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint.</hi> But a while after they became proud with the gifts of the Clergie, <hi>moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon noble horſes, with golden ſaddles, decked in moſt coſtly apparell, and with ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhooes, vulgarly called</hi> Heuſees, <hi>ſhod and ſpurred after a ſecular, or rather a prodigall manner; which turned to the hurt and opprobrie of their Order and profeſsion, exerciſing the office and tyrannie of Legats, and exacting and extorting procurations, and account twentie ſhillings for a procuration but a ſmall matter. Firſt then they goe to the chiefeſt Prelats of England, and ſhamefully exact money from them for the Popes vſe, vnder ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> paines, ſetting too ſhort a time for anſwer or payment, and ſhewing the Popes thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering letters, as ſo many threatning hornes put forth.</hi> In ſo much that the Biſhop of Lincolne, who had euer protected the Order of the Minorites, and was minded to haue made himſelfe one of them, <hi>ſeeing ſuch a monſtrous transformation,</hi> was wholly aſtonied: and that ſo much the more, for that they demaunded of his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Biſhopricke ſix thouſand markes. Neither yet is the Pope moued at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint made vnto him thereof at Lyons, but although they appeale vnto him, yet are they conſtrained with all kind of rigour. But we muſt bring here the whole Author throughout, if we ſhould ſet downe all that he ſaith of theſe tyrannicall exactions: it ſufficeth vs here for concluſion, to ſhew the deſcription that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> maketh of the miſerable ſtate of the Church of England vnder <hi>Gregorie</hi> and <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent;</hi> vnder <hi>Gregorie</hi> in theſe words, <hi>In thoſe times faith waxed cold, and ſcarcely ſeemed to ſparkle, being almoſt brought to aſhes: For ſimonie was practiſed without bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, vſurers openly by diuers occaſions did ſhameleſly extort money from the meaner ſort of people: Charitie is dead, the libertie of the Church is withered away, Religion is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vile and baſe, and the daughter Sion is as a bold-faced harlot, hauing no ſhame.</hi> And of the Court of Rome he properly ſpeaketh, plentifull ſetting forth the iniuries thereof, which he concludeth in this one word, <hi>Armato ſupplicat enſe potens, He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth vs with a ſword ſet to our throats. It were better for vs to dye, than to ſee the euils of our nation, &amp; of the Saints.

All the houſes, of which the election pertaineth to the Pope, are thereby deſtroyed. Patronage is now a burden, not an honour, a damage, not a profit. O Pope, Father of fathers, why ſuffereſt thou the climats of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to be defiled with ſuch perſons? Worthily therefore, worthily being chaſed from thine owne citie and ſeat, as another vagabond Cain, thou art forced to baniſhment, thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies proſper, thou flieſt before the partakers of Frederick, and they which perſecute thee are ſwift and mightie.

                  <p>In France, vnder the raigne of S. <hi>Lewis, Innocent</hi> ſpared vs not the more, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he ſoiourned there: heare what the ſame Author ſaith, Hee is no ſooner come to Lyons, but without the conſent of the Chapiter he would giue away the vacant Prebends: the Canons reſiſt him to his face, &amp; threaten thoſe to whom he giues them, That if they came thither the Archbiſhop ſhould not bee able to hinder them from caſting them headlong into the riuer Rhoſne. But as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paſſed further, others more entermedled in it; <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>all and euerie one ſaw and perceiued, that the Pope did inſatiably gape after money and ſpoyle, to the dammage <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and impoueriſhment of many. And many alreadie did not beleeue, that he had the ſame power of binding and looſsing as was granted from heauen to S. Peter, being knowne to be altogether vnlike to S. Peter. In France many noblemen conſpired againſt the Pope and the Church, which we neuer remember to haue happened before, as may bee ſeene in this Charter written in the French tongue,</hi> which is there at large expreſſed: the ſumme of it is this, All the confederats, whoſe ſeales did hang at that writing, vnite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues together for to defend their rights and prerogatiues againſt the Court of Rome; and there was named for heads of the league, the Duke of Bourgondie, the Earle <hi>Perron</hi> of Britaine, and the Earles of Angoleſme and of S. Paul, who, if any of the league haue need, are to helpe them with neceſſarie forces; and that, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſay they, becauſe the Clergie made them of worſe condition than the Heathens, of whom God ſaid, Giue vnto <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things that are <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and vnto God the things that are Gods: and by theſe new cuſtoms aboliſhed their ancient priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, whereas indeed the kingdome had not beene gotten by the pride of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, but by the ſouldiers and men of warre. Which when the Pope vnderſtood, fearing leaſt that were done by intelligence with <hi>Frederick,</hi> he thought it his wiſeſt courſe to content them in their grieuances, and to appeaſe the chiefeſt by giuing them ſtore of benefices; yet neuertheleſſe he ſendeth the Friers Preachers and Minors to all the Prelats of France, who require of them to lend him money, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to reſtore it them ſo ſoone as he ſhould be able to take his breath: <hi>But king <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Lewis ſuſpecting the couetouſneſſe of the Court of Rome, forbad all the Prelats of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, vnder paine of looſing all their goods, that none ſhould in any ſuch ſort impoueriſh his land.</hi> And ſo <hi>theſe ſophiſticall Legats of the Pope</hi> departed out of the kingdome, <hi>hiſſed at and derided of all men.</hi> Yet true it is (ſaith the Author) that after infinit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortions in France, <hi>worthie of eternall ſilence,</hi> the Pope conſented to king <hi>Lewis,</hi> in fauour of his voyage to the Holie land, that he might collect a tenth for three yeares, on condition that himſelfe might alſo for other three yeares following re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the like; which was with ſuch rigour extorted, that the Churchman that had yearely but twenty ſhillings comming in, and was readie to periſh for hunger, was
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:15502:210"/>
conſtrained, without all pitie, to pay two of them: and of this crueltie he bringeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> many examples. And for that king S. <hi>Lewis</hi> did permit or tollerate the Pope to make theſe extortions in his kingdome, it was vndoubtedly beleeued, that his voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to the Holie Land tooke ſuch vnfortunat ſucceſſe. Now of all theſe, as wee haue aboueſaid, theſe new Friers Preachers and Minorites were the executors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Popes ordinarie Publicans or Toll-gatherers, who in the meane time alſo deuoured one another, <hi>And which is terrible and of vnluckie preſage,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>no Monaſticke Order in the ſpace of three or foure hundred yeares or vpwards, hath growne ſo much, and ſo ſoone neere a downefall, as is their Order in twentie foure yeres, that their manſions were firſt founded in England. When any great and rich men lye at point of death, they come diligently about them, to draw profit and riches from them, not without <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the hurt and hinderance of the Ordinaries, and wreſt from them confeſsions and ſecret te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaments, onely recommending vnto them their Order, and preferring it before all others: So that no faithfull man beleeues to be ſaued, vnleſſe he be gouerned by the counſels of the Preachers and Minorites, who are carefull of getting priuiledges, are Counſellors, Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaines, and Treaſurers, in the Courts of Kings and Potentates, Paranymphes and mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-makers, executors of the Popes extortions; in their preachings either flatterers or moſt biting reprouers; and in confeſsions either diſcloſers, or vndiſcreet reprehenders.</hi> Who doth not here perceiue the true picture of the Ieſuites? And there he further ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth downe the great priuiledges giuen by the Pope, for to bee ſerued of them, which in this and other places may be read. <hi>Mathew</hi> noteth, That when they had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> diſcouered that the king of Norway was deuout, <hi>with great induſtrie they prouided a certaine ſtone of white marble,</hi> which they ſaid they had bought for a great price, wherein they fained was printed the ſole of the foot of our Lord aſcending vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen: That others of them ſhewed ſome of the bloud of Chriſt, and milke of the Virgine <hi>Marie.</hi> In thoſe firſt ages of the Church (gentle Reader) when all things were freſher, how commeth it that there is no ſpeech of any ſuch things? And in the mean time this good Monk addeth, <hi>In theſe dayes</hi> multi generati per in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubos, <hi>many children were begotten by ſpirits;</hi> which ſeeing it followeth together in the ſame place, there is none but may vnderſtand what is meant thereby.</p>

                     <hi>Gregorie</hi> attempteth to ſtretch forth his hands vnto the Eaſt parts, and behold <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> with what ſucceſſe. By reaſon of the conqueſt made of Conſtantinople by the Weſterne people, the Emperour <hi>Baldwin</hi> had ſubmitted the Church of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople to that of Rome, in hope to be the better aided of the Pope, for the ſtrengthening of his new Empire, and there reſted onely, to agree the controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of religion. Therefore <hi>Germane</hi> Patriarch of Conſtantinople writeth vnto <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie,</hi> That he deſired nothing more than to enter into conference about them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing readie (old as hee was) to reſort to any place where need ſhould be, to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: But (ſaith he) <hi>becauſe no man euer can ſee the ſpots of his owne face, vnleſſe hee looke himſelfe in a glaſſe, or be certified by ſome other, whether his face be ſpotted or not; ſo we haue many great and ſhining myrrors, namely, the Goſpell of Chriſt, the Epiſtles of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the Apoſtles, and the bookes of the Fathers; let vs looke into them, they will ſhew vs how euerie man beleeueth,</hi> ſiue nothè ſiue legitimè, <hi>falſely or truely.</hi> The ſame alſo to the Cardinals, but that he paſſeth further: <hi>There is a ſcruple of offence bred in our minds, that gaping onely after earthlie poſſeſsions yee gather together the gold and the ſiluer that yee can from any place extort, &amp; yet ſay yee are the diſciples of him</hi> (to wit <hi>Peter) that ſaid, Siluer and gold haue I none: Yee make kingdomes tributarie vnto you: yee multiplie mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes by negotiations: yee vnteach by your actions that which yee teach with your mouth.

                     <hi>Fearing perhaps the tyrannie and couetouſneſſe thereof; the Pope and Cardinalls hauing a diligent treatie thereupon, they reſolue to turne the whole armie of croſſed ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers againſt them: And a publication thereof being made, many are croſsed to goe againſt the Greekes, and chiefely them of Conſtantinople.</hi> He addeth, <hi>This was the ſeed of ſchiſme betweene the Roman and the Greeke Church. A certaine Archbiſhop canonically choſen to a noble Archbiſhopricke in Greece, went to Rome to be confirmed, but could not obtaine it, vnleſſe he would promiſe</hi> infinitum aurum, <hi>aboundance of money for the ſame. But hee, without doing any thing, returned, deteſting the ſimonie of the Court, and told it to all the Nobilitie of Greece: And others that had beene at Rome, witneſſed the like and worſe actions; and ſo all, in that Gregories time, departed from the ſubiection of the Church <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of Rome.</hi> Hereupon the Authour giueth his judgement: <hi>The Greeke Church hauing ſeene ſo much malice and oppreſsion, riſe vp againſt the Roman, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling their Emperour, obeyed onely their Archbiſhop Germane of Conſtantinople.</hi> Not long after the Patriarch of Antioch alſo followed the ſame ſteps, and proceeded ſo farre as to excommunicat <hi>Gregorie, Solemnely preaching, That he and his Church in time and dignitie was to be preferred before the Pope and the Church of Rome, and that it was more excellent than the Roman Church, becauſe the Apoſtle Peter had firſt gouerned with great honour the Church of Antioch the ſpace of ſeuen yeeres, and there was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with all due reuerence, and likewiſe eſtabliſhed in the Chaire; whereas at Rome he was manifoldly vexed with many iniuries and reproaches, and at length ſuffered vnder the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Emperour Nero a cruell death, with his fellow Apoſtle S. Paul, the ſpeciall Doctor of the Gentiles. The power of binding and looſsing he rather beſtowed on the Greeke than on the Roman Church, which is now manifeſtly defamed with the ſpots of ſimonie, vſurie, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, and other enormities.</hi> And theſe things paſſed in the Eaſt.</p>
                  <p>What ſhall we ſay then, if the Romans themſelues haue not been able to hold their peace? When <hi>Gregorie</hi> went about to excommunicat them, they ſpake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, maintaining, That for no cauſe the citie ought to be ſubiect to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict: And the Pope replied, <hi>That he was leſſe than God, but greater than any man whatſoeuer, therefore greater than any citizen, yea than any King or Emperour.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Magiſtrats and Senators exacted a yearely tribute of the Roman Church, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> which they of new and auncient right were euer in perpetuall poſſeſſion of, vntill <hi>Gregories</hi> time. He anſwered, That this was a free gift which the Church vnder perſecution was woont to giue for to redeeme their peace, which ought not grow into a cuſtome, ſeeing for ſo many ages there had beene no perſecution at Rome, but that which the Popes themſelues vſed againſt others. If this right had had none other foundation, who can doubt, but that many ages afore that, they would haue exclaimed againſt it, and aboliſhed it. Thirdly, the Romans extended their countie or bounds of their juriſdiction, ſo that they included therin Viterbe, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talto, and other towns &amp; caſtles, which were pretended to belong to the Church.
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:15502:211"/>
He anſwered, That this was to vſurpe another mans right, <hi>and that Chriſt on the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> croſſe by his bloud had made the citie of Rome ſo free, that the gates of hell could nothing preuaile againſt it.</hi> Note, gentle Reader, the pleaſant diuinitie of this Pope. For theſe cauſes therefore contentions being debated betweene the Pope and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, he with his Cardinals depart the citie, and withdraw themſelues to Perou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa; thence he thundereth forth an excommunication againſt them: whence came (as the ſame Author ſaith) warres, and many conflicts, and great effuſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian bloud for many yeares. And for this cauſe <hi>Innocent</hi> his ſucceſſor ſet no firme footing at Rome, but aſſigned a Councell at Lyons; and alſo by his Embaſſadors requeſted <hi>Henrie</hi> the third, king of England, That he might with his good leaue ſoiourne at Bourdeaux, becauſe the brethren of king S. <hi>Lewis</hi> (being priſoner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the Infidels) did vehemently preſſe him to make peace with <hi>Frederick.</hi> But the wiſeſt men of England (ſaith <hi>Mathew</hi>) feared ſuch a gueſt, <hi>Becauſe from thence he might ſoone paſſe by ſhip into England, and by his preſence make it worſe, and defile it.</hi> And this is that which Cardinall <hi>Iohn</hi> the Ciſtertian Monke ſaid, in his admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Innocent,</hi> aboue recited, <hi>We are in exile, chaſed from the Papall ſeat, from Rome it ſelfe, yea and from Italie.</hi>

The Eccleſiaſticall dignities of theſe men, were first confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon them by our Emperors and Princes: then, fom the time of the Emperour Henry the fift, the Clergie and people being aſſembled, and ſuffrages by each man particularly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, they were choſen, with the ioint conſent of the people and all the Prieſts, the common <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Paſtours of ſoules; and at length, in the time of this Frederick the ſecond, by the Clergie alone, the people excluded. For which cauſes the Biſhops of thoſe times, in their titles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of Epistles, and Decrees, did not write</hi> Apoſtolicae ſedis gratia, <hi>that is to ſay, By the fauour of man, as now they doe: but after the manner of S. Paul,</hi> ſola miſeratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne diuina, <hi>By the only mercy of God, they acknowledged they had receiued that gift and office, &amp;c. Wherefore Gregorie would take away and make voide this order, and ſubuert this authoritie of Biſhops, and reduce all things to the power of one man; neither could he otherwiſe oppreſſe Frederick, whom they openly proclaimed their moſt deare and moſt pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prince, and ſeemed they would in no wiſe for ſake him, matters remaining as they did.</hi> The Emperour then (ſaith the Authour) after he had appeaſed the rebellion of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Auſtria, came to winter at Turin, and <hi>Gregorie</hi> by the counſaile of one <hi>Mathew</hi> a preaching Frier <hi>(for there is nothing that ſuch ſort of men will not vndertake)</hi> entreth into a league with <hi>Iames Tiepoli</hi> Duke of Venice, hauing allured into the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacie the Biſhops of Milan, Bononia, Breſſe, and others of Lombardie, ouer whom was appointed Generall, <hi>Gregorie de Montelongo,</hi> that they might breake forth into open rebellion, vpon the firſt occaſion offered. And leaſt <hi>Frederick</hi> ſhould receiue aid from Germanie, he won the Germane Princes and Captaines, according as he vnderſtood they were led with couetouſneſſe or ambition, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributing

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> vnto them the Tenthes and other Eccleſiaſticall goods, for to engage them againſt their Biſhops: and did ſo much by the cunning practiſes of himſelfe and of the Preaching Friars, that working vpon the paſſions and naughtie affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, he brought a good part of Germanie to ſheath their ſwords in their owne bowels. Wherefore, things thus ſet in order, he proceedeth to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate <hi>Frederick,</hi> and vnder pretence of zeale, the conſpirators of Italy take armes; at the ſame time aſſemble the troupes of Germanie, aſſiſted with his Legats, men of chiefe authoritie, but particularly pricked forwards by one <hi>Albert Behan,</hi> a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Churchman, factious and learned, to whom he had committed the care of the whole buſineſſe for foure yeares, hauing firſt by oth ſecretly bound him vnto him, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and armed him to that end with three Bulls. The firſt was an inuectiue againſt <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick,</hi> a Prince (as it ſaid) beleeuing amiſſe concerning Chriſt, hauing none other drift than to ouerthrow Chriſtian Religion, which that he may more eaſily effect, he laboureth to bring the Pope and Cardinalls into extreame pouertie. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond conteined an interdiction of Diuine ſeruice to all the followers of <hi>Frederick,</hi> and pronounced all his officers, vaſſalls and ſubiects, abſolued from their oth of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie. The third, a prohibition, that no man of what qualitie or condition ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, ſhould aſſiſt him in deed, word, or will, vnder paine of eternall damnation. And he fortified theſe Bulls with gifts, benefices, and dignities, for to corrupt and win more eaſily the Counſellors &amp; Secretaries of Princes, according as he knew <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> each man more or leſſe capable of this ſeruice. And here <hi>Auentine</hi> declareth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly all the circumſtances. Thus at length this mightie rebellion in Germany brake forth; and at the ſame time were theſe Buls carried about by the Preaching Friers. But on the other part <hi>Conrade</hi> ſonne of <hi>Frederick</hi> calleth to him all the good men, and inuiteth the faithfull Princes and cities of the Empire to their due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and ſetleth himſelfe to a defence. Of all the Biſhops to whom thoſe Buls came, not any one obeyed the Pope, and of all the Abbots as few: they all were aſtonied at this noueltie, all are inflamed with anger, all proteſt publikely, <hi>That the Pope hath in Germanie no right, without the conſent of the Biſhops of Germanie. Let the Biſhop of Rome</hi> (ſay they) <hi>feed his Italians: We being ordained of God dogs of the flocke, will keepe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> away the Wolues that come couered in ſheepes skinnes.

Alſo the Biſhop of Bamberge taketh the meſſengers of <hi>Albert</hi> and ſtrippeth them: the Biſhop of Brixen ſtoppeth the paſſages of the Alps, to the end that none might go to Rome: the ſame did alſo the Biſhop of Alteich, whom he had excommunicat for pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God for <hi>Frederick.</hi> In a word, <hi>All the Biſhops not onely called his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

All which the Pope was aduertiſed of by a deuout old <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> woman named <hi>Katherine Begute,</hi> and a certaine young ſtripling called <hi>Henrie,</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes ſent from <hi>Albert</hi> into Italie. In this extremitie they haue recourſe to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition: <hi>Agnes</hi> the Dukes wife was <hi>religious</hi> (he might haue ſaid more truely ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious:) <hi>Albert</hi> deceiueth her by <hi>Henrie</hi> the Dukes Secretarie; Prouoſt of Munſter, and <hi>Theodoric Otholim</hi> her houſhold Chaplaine, they affirming vnto her, <hi>That on the feaſt eue of Saint Philip and Iacob, whileſt they were in their quiet ſleepe, they ſaw twice a ſword let downe from heauen to Albert, the Virgine mother of God and the Apoſtles of Yuorie, with inſcription in letters of gold, That they approued and confirmed all the actions of Albert, and made themſelues authors of all that he ſhould take in hand.</hi> Whereupon he boldly commaunded the Biſhops of Ausbourg and of Eichſtat,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> That they ſhould depriue from the communion of the Church, all the cities of their dioceſſes that had ſent men of warre to <hi>Frederick:</hi> but none obeyeth him. Then he calleth them together to Landſhut, yet no man alſo appeareth. At laſt the Pope in his fauour ſendeth to the Canons and religious perſons, that they ſhould chuſe themſelues other Prelats: neither are yet theſe any thing moued. He citeth to Rome out of euerie dioceſſe, them that <hi>Albert</hi> deſigned vnto him: but no man prepareth himſelfe to goe thither. In the meane time <hi>Eberard</hi> Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Saltzbourg, and <hi>Radiger</hi> Biſhop of Bathaw, goe to <hi>Otho</hi> Duke of Baua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, admoniſh him of his duetie, promiſe him the Emperours fauour, and intreat him to be preſent in their aſſemblie at Ratisbone, there with a great number of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Biſhops to treat of the affaires of the Commonwealth; which he granted them. Then <hi>Eberard</hi> Archbiſhop of Saltzbourg opened his boſome in an Oration, which we haue at length ſet downe in <hi>Auentine,</hi> where after he hath ſaid vnto them for Preface, That Chriſt had left vnto vs for his badge, whereby we may be diſcerned from others, the duetie of loue and peace; <hi>He earneſtly alſo,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>admoniſheth vs, that we ſhould auoid falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophets, who couered with ſheepes skins, that is, vnder the name of a Chriſtian, and title of Pope, ſeeke to haue dominion ouer vs, and delude vs. Whom he teacheth vs to know by their thornes and workes, namely, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, exceſſe, contention, hatred, enuie, warres, diſcord, deſire of domination, ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. With what words could the Emperour of heauen more plainely haue demonſtrated vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> vs the Scribes and Phariſies of Babylon? If we be not blind we may diſcerne vnder the title of Soueraigne Biſhop, in Paſtors clothing, a moſt cruell Wolfe. The Biſhops of Rome take armes against all Chriſtians, make themſelues great by preſuming, deceiuing, and ſowing warre out of warre: They kill the ſheepe, deſtroy peace, driue concord out of the land, draw out of hell ciuile warres and domeſtick ſeditions, &amp;c. They prouide not for their flocke after the manner of a Biſhop, but rather after the manner of tyrans they licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rage in crueltie.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> this confuſion of things: <hi>Hildebrand about an hundred and ſeuentie yeares agoe, vnder ſhew of religion, firſt laid the foundation of the Empire of Antichriſt, firſt began the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible warre which his ſucceſſors haue continued euer ſince till now. At firſt they exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Emperour from the election of Popes, and tranſported it to the people and Clergie: And afterwards hauing had both theſe in mockerie and ſcorne, they now alſo labour to conſtraine vs to ſubiection and ſeruitude, that they may raigne alone; and being now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the cuſtome of commaund, and hauing often weighed their owne and their aduerſaries forces, they vſe the ſpecious colour of Eccleſiaſticall libertie, for an occaſion of violently taking to them domination, and of oppreſsing Chriſtian libertie. Beleeue him that hath experience of it, They will not ceaſe till they haue brought the Emperour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> diſsipated the honour of the Roman Empire, oppreſſed the true Paſtors which feed, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away the dogs that can barke, that after this manner they may extinguiſh and deſtroy all things. They would therefore confound all things together in vprores, yet euen in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight they contend for dominion. Paul the ſtorehouſe of Philoſophie commaundeth, Be yee ſubiect one to another in the feare of Chriſt, &amp;c. That ſupreme Maieſtie tooke vpon him the forme of a ſeruant, that he might ſerue his Diſciples, and waſh their feet. The Biſhops of Babylon couet to raigne alone, they cannot endure any equall: They will not giue ouer till they haue troden all things vnder their feet, and ſit in the Temple of God, and be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted aboue all that is worſhipped: Their hungring after riches, and thirſting after honors, cannot be filled; the more is giuen them, the more they deſire; reach to them a finger and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> they will couet the whole hand. This ſeruant of ſeruants coueteth, like as if hee were a God, to be Lord of Lords: He deſpiſeth the ſacred aſſemblies and Councels of his brethren, yea of his Lords: He feareth leaſt he ſhould be conſtrained to render an account of thoſe things that he doth, daily more and more, againſt lawes and commaundements,</hi> ingentia loquitur, <hi>he ſpeaketh great things, as if he were a God; meditateth new counſels in his breaſt, that he might get an Empire to himſelfe: He changeth the lawes, establiſheth his owne: He polluteth, teareth aſunder, ſpoyleth, defraudeth, killeth. This is that ſonne of perdition (whom we call Antichrist) in whoſe forehead is written this name of contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, I am God, I cannot erre.

There are ten kings likewiſe which haue diuided the whole earth (ſometime the Roman Empire) not for to gouerne, but to conſume it.

What is more cleerely manifest than this Propheſie? All the ſignes and prodigies which that our heauenly Master hath aduertiſed vs of, are alreadie come to paſſe, &amp;c.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> words are taken out of the letter that the Cardinall of Port, the Popes Legat, wrot to the Archbiſhop of Rouan, full of abaſhment; and he calleth him Anti-Pope, without imputing vnto him any other crime or doctrine; namely becauſe this <hi>Bartholomew</hi> reeſtabliſhed the order of the Church a new in thoſe Countries, and laboured to ſet true Paſtors in the places of the falſe. And the Cardinall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Archbiſhop to be preſent in a Synod holden in the Citie of Sens, to giue counſell in a buſineſſe of that importance, otherwiſe he threatned he would ſignifie his diſobedience to the Pope. This was about the yeare 1220 vnder <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius</hi> the third; and it muſt needs be, that they haue largely multiplied ſince, for the ſame Author telleth vs, that in a certaine part of Germanie, vnder <hi>Gregorie</hi> the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the ninth, a great number of them were encloſed in a place, with mariſh on the one ſide and the Sea on the other, where they were all ſlaine.

                  <hi>Louing friends, ſince our arriuall in this citie we haue performed much good, and done great almes; for at our firſt comming hither wee found three or foure ſtewes, but now at our departure we leaue but one, marrie this extends it ſelfe from the Eaſt to the Weſt gate of the citie. And theſe were verie ſcandalous words in the eares of all the women, who were preſent at the ſermon in great numbers, for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> inhabitants of the citie were cited by publike proclamation, in name of the Pope readie to depart.</hi> He therefore went downe to Genoa, and from thence he went to Mylan, where being receiued in triumphant ſort, he obliged the cities by new oathes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Emperour, many he drew againe into a new league, and they which perſeuered in fidelitie towards <hi>Conrade,</hi> he excommunicated, and moſt ſeuerely perſecuted; to conclude, he omitted no meanes whereby he might preuent <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dericks</hi> ſucceſſors entrie into Italie. When he came to Ferrara he preached to the people out of a window, and he vſed preualent perſuaſions to intimate, that this citie was his: His text was, <hi>Happie is the nation that hath the Lord for their God, and the people whom he hath choſen for his inheritance:</hi> inferring by this, that the city and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> people was happie which were particularly ſubiect to the Pope; and ſo he made but a mocke of the holie Scripture. But Hiſtoriographers wonderfully extoll this ſermon, becauſe it was no ſmall wonder that the Pope then preached. Going from thence he confirmed all the cities of Romania and Tuſcan, leauing Cardinall <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauiano</hi> behind in Lombardie with an armie: but yet being verie doubtful in mind he delayed his entrie into Rome; for the Romans through his abſence augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in reputation, &amp; the Popes leauing Rome had now for many yeres held their ſeat in diuers other places, as at Viterbe, Oruietto, Perugia, Anagnia, Aſſiſia, that there they might rule and gouerne ouer other Prouinces, being vncertaine what authoritie or power they ſhould retaine within the citie. And at this verie inſtant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the Romans called <hi>Brancalone</hi> from Bologna (a man very famous for his juſtice and equitie) to be a Senator of Rome, who doubting the petulancie and inſolencie of their Youth, would not accept of it, without being confirmed therein for three yeares, and pledges giuen him of thirtie of the chiefe citizens ſonnes, as alſo they themſelues bound by ſolemne oath to doe their vttermoſt endeuours that they might faithfully obey him; whom he preſently ſent to Bologna, there to be kept vnder ſafe cuſtodie. And queſtionleſſe he bare himſelfe ſo ſtrictly in this charge, as he ſtroke terrour into the beſt of them: but the more authoritie was aſcribed to

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> him, the more the ſame was extenuated towards the Pope. In the meane while the Romans began to grieue, that the mightie gaine which daily accrued by the wonderfull concourſe to the Roman Court, did now through the Popes abſence both ceaſe, &amp; was otherwhere diuerted; and ſo at length they ſuppoſed, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſingular imputation they could not for ſo long time haue their Biſhop wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Wherefore they ſent embaſſadours to <hi>Innocent,</hi> being at Perugia, to intreat him that he would returne to Rome, <hi>That ſo he might helpe his flocke,</hi>

                  <hi>like a good Pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtor, and that Rome might enioy her Biſhop, as other cities enioyed their Prelats: For they thought it a great abuſe and errour, that onely Rome which was inſtiled the Empreſſe of other cities, ſhould among ſo many other cities, for ſo long time be depriued of her Prelat <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and Biſhop.</hi> For (ſaith <hi>Mathew Paris</hi>) while he liued beyond the Alpes, <hi>gaping after the profit of concurrents, and opening his boſome to gifts, he was vagrant and altogether vnſetled, by being reſident amongst the Ciſalpines.</hi> But he framing delayes, they once againe vrged him after a preualent maner, <hi>Intimating to him, how they greatly wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he would run vp and downe here and there like a wandering and inſtable perſon, &amp; leauing Rome, his Pontifical ſeat, together with his ſheep, wherof he was to yeeld a ſtrict account to the ſupreme Iudge, he left them to be rent &amp; torne by the incurſions of wolues, himſelf only gaping and thirſting after coyne;</hi> as alſo with this peremptorie clauſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, <hi>That he ſhould either come then or neuer.</hi> But when he ſaw that the Romans threatned the Perugians &amp; Aſſiſians, both with ſiege &amp; ruine, if they longer detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> him, departing from Perugia he went towards Rome, <hi>yet trembling &amp; fearefull</hi> he made his entrie, becauſe it was reported, that the Romans would preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demaund of him that money which at his inſtigation they had disburſed in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts againſt <hi>Frederick.</hi> And in effect, not long after, the people required at his hands the damages which they had ſuſtained through his abſence; For (ſay they) <hi>the world knew well ynough, that he was neither Biſhop of Lyons, Perugia, nor Angiers, where hee did often reſide, but of Rome.</hi> In which verie words wee may ſee they did not acknowledge him for vniuerſall Biſhop; and out of doubt had not the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor pacified the people, he would haue vndergone ſome great troubles.</p>
               <p>Now on the other ſide <hi>Conrade, Fredericks</hi> ſonne, paſſed ouer into Italie, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> more to encourage his adherents, and diuers times conflicts and ſlaughter fel out in the cities, while the Guelphes roſe againſt the Gibellines, and the Church ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt the Empire, both of them cruelly proſecuting and ſubuerting one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: and the more horrible this warre was in that it fell out within the ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame walls, and vnder one roofe and building, that the like plots and examples of reuenge were neuer read of throughout all Antiquitie.</p>
               <p>Afterwards marching further vp into his kingdome, he tooke in Naples, which had formerly yeelded it ſelfe to the Pope, ouerthrowing his armie, ouer which his kinſman <hi>William</hi> was Generall, and putting to the ſword foure thouſand foot, which were euen the flower of the Italian Youth, he recouered all his cities, redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> his ſubiects vnder due obedience, and thus brought the Pope to a verie hard poynt. But amidſt theſe anxieties the Pope thought good to excite an oppoſit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Conrade,</hi> which was <hi>Richard</hi> Earle of Cornwall, brother to the king of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, being a Prince (according as the fame ran of him) of indomptable courage. Wherefore to this end and ſcope he offered vnto him the kingdomes of Naples and Sicily, to be held in homage of him; <hi>Vſing herein</hi> (as the Hiſtoriographer ſaith) <hi>his diabolicall ſophiſtication, who ſaid, All this will I giue thee, if falling downe thou wilt worſhip me.</hi> Beſides, his Bulls ſhould not be ſpared againſt <hi>Conrade,</hi> wherein hee ſhould be anathematized, and his ſubiects abſolued of their oath of obedience,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:15502:217"/>
with other like interdictions: for he had formerly denounced him an heretike, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the hereſie was, in that he obeyed not his interdict, and left not the kingdome to his diſpoſition. <hi>Richard,</hi> though he was earneſtly ſollicited by Legat <hi>Albertus,</hi> who was ſent to this end and purpoſe, not remaining ſatisfied in words, required pledges to be giuen him of the moſt eminent perſons of his familie, as alſo ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſummes of money to defray the charges of the warre: certaine holds alſo which lay on the frontiers of his kingdome, he demaunded to bee deliuered into his hands, whereinto, being vrged, he might at any time retire, <hi>Otherwiſe</hi> (ſaid he, ſpeaking to the Legat) <hi>it is as much as one ſhould ſay, I ſell, or giue vnto thee the Moon, aſcend and lay hold on her.</hi> When therefore they could no wayes agree vpon the matter, hee had recourſe to the king of England himſelfe, <hi>Richards</hi> brother, a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Prince (ſaith <hi>Mathew) verie credulous, and apt to embrace his owne preiudice;</hi> to whom he made offer of all the Croiſado forces, deſtined for Paleſtina, and they ſhould ſerue in this expedition. Hereupon grew a wonderfull diſcontent and murmure of the Patriarch of Ieruſalem, and all the Prelats of Paleſtina, together with the Templers and Hoſpitalers, <hi>who fell into a great deteſtation of the Popes deluſions,</hi> that hauing long time beene fed with ſuch large hopes, hee went now about, not to forſake, but rather to betray them. Yet the king of England proceeded on, and accepted of the kingdome of Sicile offered, in his ſon <hi>Edmonds</hi> name: whatſoeuer money he was able to raiſe, either of the Chriſtians or Iewes, he ſent to the Pope, and gaue him authority to raiſe what treaſure ſoeuer he could, or at what rates ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> any where in his name, <hi>and hereunto he obliged himſelfe vpon paine of depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from his Crowne and State,</hi> with which ſummes of money the Pope being bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, he leuied an armie. <hi>Conrade</hi> on the other ſide was no whit hereat diſmayed, but intended to reſiſt the Pope, and therefore he the more encouraged his nobles and ſubiects: And here our Hiſtoriographer, a Monke, burſts out into theſe words, <hi>Whether the Pope did well herein or no, let the Iudge of all Iudges decide.</hi> But for an abridgement of this warre, this miſerable Prince had poyſon preſented him, who waſting away by little and little, when he drew neere to his laſt breath, in complaining manner he vttered theſe words, <hi>The Church which ſhould bee a mother, to my father and me is rather a ſtepmother:</hi> and ſo he left behind him a ſonne, who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> was but two yeares old. Some impute this poyſon to a brother of his, others, to the Popes miniſters, which, of the two, were moſt likely, as may be preſumed by the ſtate and condition of the preſent affaires. <hi>Mathew</hi> ſaith, That hauing heard this newes, <hi>with great ioy of heart, cheerefulneſſe of countenance, and eleuation of voice, he vttered theſe words, I reioyce certainely, and ſo let all the vpholders of the Roman Church exult together with me, becauſe two of our greateſt enemies are now dead, one Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall, the other of the Laitie, Robert Biſhop of Lincolne, and Conrade king of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile.</hi> He therefore embracing this opportunitie, found it an eaſie matter to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer into his hands, Naples, Capua, and a part of the kingdome.

Neither can any ſubiect or faithfull one vnto that ſeat (in immaculat and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contaminat obedience, and no wayes by ſchiſme diſſeuered nor rent from the ſame bodie of Chriſt, and the ſame holie ſeat) obey the ſame precepts, commaundements, or iniunctions, from whence ſoeuer they come, yea though it were from the higheſt order of Angels, but of neceſsitie he must needs with his whole power contradict &amp; oppoſe them: For the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the See Apoſtolicall can enioyne nothing but that which tends to edification, and not deſtruction; for herein conſiſts the fulneſſe of power, That all things may be done to edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: and theſe things which are tearmed Prouiſions, tend no way to edification, but to manifeſt destruction. Wherefore the bleſſed ſeat Apoſtolicall may no wayes entertaine them, becauſe fleſh and bloud, which ſhall not inherit the kingdome of heauen, hath reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> theſe things, and not the father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who is in heauen.</hi> Vpon the receit of theſe letters <hi>Innocent</hi> ſo ſtormed, as <hi>he vowed by Peter and Paul, That if a certaine naturall clemencie did not diſſuade me, I would bring him to ſuch a confuſion, that he ſhould be an example, terrour, prodigie, and a verie fable to all the world: Is not the king of England our vaſſall, nay and to ſay more, our bondchild, who at a becke of our fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger can impriſon and impoſe vpon him any reproach or ſhame?</hi> And the Cardinals could hardly aſſuage his furie, by ſaying, <hi>How it was not conuenient to denounce any hard Decree againſt the Biſhop; for, to confeſſe but truth, ſaid they, theſe things are moſt true which he inferreth: Condemne him we cannot, he is a Catholike, nay and a moſt holie one, more holy, more religious, and more excellent than our ſelues, and of a farre better life, ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> as it may hardly be beleeued, that amongst all the Prelats there is any one better, or equall to him.

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Pope conniuently with diſsimulation to paſſe ouer all theſe matters, not raiſing any ſtirre or tumult thereupon.</hi> But obſerue the reaſon which he annexed to all the former al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations, <hi>Eſpecially</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>becauſe it is knowne that a departure muſt one day happen.</hi> That departure foretold by the Apoſtle in the ſecond to the Theſſalonians, cap. 2. Antichriſt himſelfe being to be the author hereof, whom they expected and looked for; not as they would haue it beleeued, from Babylon, but euen out of the heart of the Church, from Rome it ſelfe. And hereupon grew <hi>Innocents</hi> mortall hatred to Lincolne. But this verie yeare he fell ſicke in his houſe at Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, where ſpeaking to Frier <hi>Iohn</hi> of S.

Then calling about him his Clergie, and mourning for thoſe ſoules which periſhed through the auarice of the Court of Rome: <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>came into the world that he might gaine ſoules; and therefore whoſoeuer feares not to looſe ſoules, he may not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily be tearmed an Antichrist? God in ſix dayes created the whole world, but for mans <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> redemption he trauelled and ſuffered therein more than thirtie yeares: may not therefore a deſtroyer of ſoules be thought to be the enemie of God, and Antichriſt? The Pope impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently annihilates the priuiledges of the holie Roman Biſhops his predeceſſors, with this Prouiſo, Non obſtante, &amp;c.

Many Apoſtolicall perſons confirmed diuers priuiledges, which had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in pietie beene granted. Are not many alreadie ſaued through diuine grace, of farre <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> greater authoritie than one who yet hangs in danger? From whence then proceeds this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious temeritie, to fruſtrat the priuiledges of ſo many auncient Saints?</hi> And here hee ſpake liberally againſt the rapines and ſimonies of the Roman Church, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned the Friers Mendicants to be alwayes neere at hand to thoſe who were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting the world, to the end to perſuade them to bequeath a part of their goods by Will and Teſtament for the aid of the Holie Land, or if they recouered health to vow a journey thither. <hi>They ſold the Croiſado to lay perſons, euen as they were woont to ſell oxen and ſheepe in the Temple: they ſold many things, and theſe, peraduenture, to be appropriated to their owne vſes.

Secondly, That though the liuelie diuine eſſence be one and the ſelfeſame in the Father, the Sonne, and the holie Ghoſt, yet as it comes within the reaſon and compaſſe of Forme, it is one in the Father and the Sonne, and not alike vnto theſe in the holie Ghoſt; and yet Forme is the ſame thing with diuine Eſſence. Thirdly, That the holie Ghoſt as he is Loue, and connexed, doth not proceed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> from the Sonne, but onely from the Father.

And in that it was not fit the king of England ſhould ſo ſoone diſcouer the fraud intended to him, a Legat was ſent, which by a ring inueſted <hi>Edmond</hi> his ſonne king of Apulia and Sicilia: and this incircumſpect Prince thought that hee both poſſeſſed the cities and the harts of the ſubiects too. Wherfore he preſently ſet forward on his journy, taking care for nothing, but how he might conuey his treaſure through France.

For though that Court had many times with great bitterneſſe of ſpirit terrified Chriſts faithfull ones, yet it neuer ſo mortally wounded, both in generall and particular, the ſeruants of Chriſt, as both in this and the yeare following; for innocents were enforced to idolatrtes, and as Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to renounce truth, which is God himſelfe.</hi> And here the Author ſtayes a little in declaring ſome circumſtances, which were theſe, <hi>Prelats were ſold like Oxen and Aſſes: Behold the vttermoſt condition of ſeruitude: behold the ſellers which ſhould haue beene caſt out of the Temple and beene whipped. But becauſe it is a more vnworthie thing to commit an iniurie violently, than to ſuffer innocently, it may be thought that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining crie of this will aſcend vp vnto the Lord God of reuenge.</hi> But at length he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, <hi>The Pope hath power in all thoſe things which tend to edification, not in thoſe which lead to ruine,</hi> according to <hi>Robert</hi> Biſhop of Lincolne.</p>
               <p>Neither did matters ſucceed any better with him in other places; for (ſaith he) when they perceiued his actions ſo different from thoſe prayers which at his firſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> comming to the chaire he had cauſed to be made in his behalfe, <hi>Manies deuotion grew coole towards him, and diuers conſtrued it to be meere hypocriſie, and masking of his ſecular power;</hi> therefore their former hopes conceiued of his ſanctimonie fell to the ground.

The Romans moued the Pope, that out of his Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall prerogatiue he would commaund the Bolognians to deliuer them: who to gratifie the Romans, omitted neither threats nor intreats herein; yet hee had the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> deniall. Then the people roſe againſt the Nobilitie, and in deſpight both of them and the Pope reſtored and ſet at libertie <hi>Brancalone.</hi> The Pope, being hereunto ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited by the Nobilitie, excommunicated both the Senator and all his followers, that is to ſay, the people of Rome, <hi>omnes cachi nantes,</hi> all of them with ſcorne and laughter condemned and mocked at his threatnings. The Senator ſuppreſſed all the ſeditious, not ſparing the Popes friends and neere kinsfolkes; and at length he vrged himſelfe to forſake the citie, and threatned to demoliſh his natural town and countrey Anagnia. The matter came to this paſſe, that, will he nill he, in verie ſubmiſſe and humble words, he was enforſt by Legats to intreat them to forbeare

A Diet therefore was called at Wirtzberge, where his demaunds and patents were opened, being corroborated and vrged with many intimations and reaſons. By a generall conſent the Archbiſhop of Collen roſe vp, who oppoſing himſelfe, appealed to a generall Councell; and as he was deliuering there reaſons, according to the charge impoſed vpon him, hee was by the Cardinall interrupted, threatened, and excommunicated.

This wicked race of arch Synagoguiſts will neuer giue ouer before they haue brought vs all to pouertie, &amp; ſlauiſh ſeruitude.</hi> And comparing the Popes to the Iewiſh Prieſts, <hi>Our owne diſcord</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>brought forth this incoueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Theſe impoſters haue made vſe of our differences, and as long as they are vpheld the Chriſtians will neuer be able to enioy happie peace, to auoyd the miſeries of warre, or to exerciſe pietie and charitie one towards another. They lately ſet the Sueuians and Saxons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> together by the eares, then did they depriue both of State and life Frederick the ſecond, an excellent member of the Chriſtian Commonwealth, and Conrade the fourth, both Sueuian, and worthie Princes. The impes of Sathan and Antichriſt ſowed ſeditions and diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Germanie, then afterwards by fraud and deceit they intercepted and put to death Conrade, a moſt innocent and harmeleſſe yong gentleman, of ſingular hopes, and one might ſay, an ofſpring of heauen, in ſeeking, by the law of nations, but to recouer the inheritance of his royall progenitors. They ſtirred vp the Sueuians againſt the French (Conrade</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Charles) cauſing them to take vp armes, as a ſpectacle of pleaſure and delight to themſelues; afterwards againſt theſe they excited the Spaniards, and now they would ſet vs againſt the French and Spaniards, being our conſanguinians, and comming here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> out of Germanie</hi> (to driue both the one and other out of Italie.) <hi>You muſt needs remember what that famous Decimiſt, Gregorie the tenth, about ten yeres ſince, did with his tenthes, and the ſame will this Honorius the fourth doe with his fourthes. Thus this ſubtill Gregorie, to wipe vs of theſe tenthes, he armed against vs the Scythians, Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and Turkes: And, if I ſhould not lye, I verily beleeue, conſidering the great profits that come in to him by this meanes, that be wiſhes better to them than vs. Theſe of the Order of S.

and his Decrees paſse vnder the forme rather of ſubtiltie and deceit, than of open e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and iuſtice. And euen as Sathan transformes himſelfe into an Angell of light, ſo doe they inuent meanes and deuiſes how to caſt a miſt before the peoples eyes. And that theſe things are no wayes agreeable nor pleaſing to Christ our Lord and God, the euents and iſſues, except we be vtterly blind, doe plainely proue, daily effects teach vs, and the holie Scriptures in euerie place declare and manifeſt. Wherefore, moſt reuerend Fathers in Chriſt, wake your ſelues out of this ſleepe, prouide and ſuccour things almoſt loſt and periſhed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and defend the Commonwealth. Our predeceſſors, who notwithſtanding held not then the Empire, did euer ſhake off the Roman yoke, though they were a people expert in armes, skilfull in militarie diſcipline, conquerors of nations, ſubduers of the whole world, and a terror to mankind, not well enduring their Empire ſo much as ouer confining and borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> countries, and ſhall we (not to ſpeake more bitterly) baſely ſubmit our ſelues to boyes and effeminats? What this Tuſculan is I am not ignorant, I know well his maners and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions, he is a gold-ſucker, an vſurer, a perfidious man, and a ſeruile ſlaue to money and coyne. I lightly esteeme of his threatnings, and appeale vnto the generall Councell of the whole Chriſtian Commonwealth. When Probus had vttered theſe words, and all the rest both approued and followed his opinion, Tuſculan fearing ſome violence to be offered, and therefore not daring to come abroad, in a few dayes by little and little they all ſlunke away. And ſo nothing at all being done in the matter, the aſſembly was diſſolued.</hi> But the Pope for reuenge of this contumelie, thundered excommunication againſt <hi>Probus,</hi> and did what he could to depriue him of his Biſhopricke.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

This execution therefore was cloſely and priuily performed, and with as little ſcandall as poſsible might be to the Friers, through the ſpeciall diligence of Cardinall Hugo, and the Biſhop of Meſsina, both which were of the Predicant Order: ſo as this tumult at that time ceaſed and ſlept.</hi> The opinions of this Goſpell were theſe, <hi>That God the Father raigned vnder the Law, and the Sonne vnder Grace, but by the riſing of the foure Orders Mendicants, the holie Ghoſt began then to raigne, and ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſhould doe while the end of the world; and that from this time forward they onely ſhould be ſaued, that beleeued in this new Goſpell: That Chriſts Goſpell was not true, perfect, nor ſufficient to ſaluation, as alſo his Sacraments were of little eſteeme; but if this new one were compared with that, it as farre exceeded it as the Sunne doth the Moone, and ſo conſequently, that the Church which ſhould be grounded on this new Goſpell, would in the ſame proportion excell the other precedent.</hi> The authors notwithſtanding of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions, which were to be extirpated, the Pope did tollerat and ſupport; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe any thing whatſoeuer, ſeemes juſt and equall to them, ſo it make for their prerogatiue and power; and they were afraid eſpecially, leaſt theſe their huckſters ſhould grow out of grace with the people, by whoſe tongues and talons ſo much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> good bootie and ſpoyle came vnto their hands.

               <p>AFter <hi>Nicholas</hi> death, the Cardinals by reaſon of the intemperature of the aire left Rome, and went to Perugia: and ſome were readie to affirme that all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> diſaſters, which <hi>Nicholas</hi> brought vpon Chriſtendome grew from this, that he was choſen at Rome in an infectious time.

And in the firſt conſiſtorie, reſoluing to reforme the Roman Church, after Chriſts example, he made ſhew that he would ride on an Aſſe, and that the Cardinals ſhould doe the like, which was a thing remote from their manners &amp; cuſtoms: afterwards they wilfully ſuffered him to fall into many groſſe and childiſh petulancies, through his inexperience, that euerie man might hereby plainly diſcern how requiſit it was to make choyce of another.

                  <hi>he preſented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in imperiall habit, which was verie reſplendent and remarquable, in an imperiall Diadem; when hauing a naked ſword borne before him; and ſitting on a throne he vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a loud voyce: Behold here two ſwords.</hi> And now Authors exclaime, <hi>Here, O Peter, thou ſeest thy ſucceſſour; and Sauiour Chriſt, thou maiſt here diſcerne thy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Vicar:</hi> (The which words notwithſtanding, many father vpon himſelfe.) See to what height the pride of the ſeruant of ſeruants is mounted vnto.</p>
               <p>And becauſe he would not be ſatisfied in theſe extremities, he proſecuted the matter hotly in effect: For he publiſhed a decretall, which is in the extrauagants, wherein he peremptorily declared: <hi>That faith vrging vs thereunto, we were bound and obliged to beleeue one holie Catholike Church, and that to be Apoſtolicall.</hi> And from this he brings vs to the Roman Church, to obey one Pope: to whom in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Peter</hi> it was ſayd, <hi>Feed my ſheepe:</hi> ſo as whether they were Grecians or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>they were not to be accounted Chriſts ſheepe except they obayed him. In this, and his power,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are comprehended two ſwords, that is the temporall, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> as in the ſayd goſpels we are taught: For the Apoſtles ſaying to our Sauiour, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold here two ſwords; that is to ſway in the Church: when the Apoſtles thus ſpake, our Lord did not anſwer, It was too much, but, It was ſufficient. And queſtionleſſe he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, the temporall ſword to bee in Peters power, ill vnderſtands our Lords words when he ſaies, Put thy ſword into the ſcabberd:</hi> Arguing out of theſe words quite contrarie to the Fathers ſence made thereof, <hi>That both the materiall and ſpirituall ſword, was in the Churches power; but the one to be vſed for the Church, the other of the Church: one by the hand of the Prieſt, the other by the hand of Kings and ſouldiers, but this by direction and permiſſion of the Prieſt, that is of the Pope: but,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>one ſword muſt be vnder another, and the authoritie temporall muſt be ſubiect to that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſpirituall: For when the Apoſtle ſaies, there is no power but of God, and that power which is, is ordayned of God; and ordayned it ſhould not be except one ſword were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der another, and as the inferiour were not by another reduced to ſupremeſt power:</hi> And here againe ſhameleſly againſt his owne vnderſtanding and conſcience, he cites the Apoſtle in theſe words (behold the place) <hi>Let euerie ſoule be ſubiect to the higher powers; for there is no power but of God, and whatſoeuer power is, is ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God.</hi> In which words, by all the Fathers explications, it is manifeſt that the Apoſtle in this place meant temporall powers, he in thoſe generall words, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting no man from their obedience, of what qualitie or order ſoeuer he were.

Then he goes forward, <hi>affirming, That we muſt needs confeſſe the ſpirituall power ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> farre in dignitie and worth to excell the temporall, as things ſpirituall goe beyond things temporall: and thus the propheſie of Ieremie is verified in the power of the Church and perſons Eccleſiaſticall, Behold this day I haue ſet thee ouer nations and kingdomes, with the reſt which enſues. If therefore any temporall power erre and offend, he muſt be iudged by the ſpirituall; but if the ſpirituall inferiour ſwarue or erre, he muſt be tryed by his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour.</hi> Which ſence of that place none of the Auncients euer applied to the Pope: and thus he might eaſily be victorious, where he had no oppoſite.

Is the Biſhop of Rome then onely a faithfull one, in that he onely aſſumes to himſelfe this power and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue? And thus in their Decretalls the Popes make as meere a mock of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, no leſſe than Roman Paſquill doth. Yet notwithſtanding out of theſe ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous antecedents he impudently concludes, <hi>We therefore affirme, declare, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and pronounce, That vnder paine ſaluation euerie creature must be ſubiect to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Pope of Rome.</hi> But now let vs ſee how wicked an vſe he makes of ſo impious a Decretall.</p>

Some ſay the cauſe was, in that there they might more freely wallow in their delights than in another place, though this no doubt they might haue done in Italie: but this ſeemes to bee the more ſolide reaſon, Becauſe at Rome, through the ſupreme authoritie &amp; pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Senators and Nobilitie, they were kept within due bounds, being often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times driuen with their whole Court to remoue to Perugia, Viterbe, Oruietto, Anagnia, and Aſſiſia; And his predeceſſors hauing in diuers voyages into France <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> met with a more open &amp; courteous conuerſation, hauing here greater reuerence vouchſafed them than at Rome, as not being there yet ſo plainely diſcouered and looked into: Theſe men alſo hoped they ſhould more peaceably raigne in Auig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and from hence, with leſſe oppoſition, extend their authoritie and power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer other nations.

Neither ſhall you read of any man who alledged, That Rome was S. <hi>Peters</hi> ſeat, or that wee muſt goe thither where the holie Ghoſt had his reſidence. Out of queſtion Auignion, which liked and pleaſed them well, was then to them no leſſe the ſame than the other: whereas now at this day they referre the vniuerſal Church to Rome onely, as alſo onely to Rome this ſeat and chaire. When the Cardinals came to Lyons, they crowned <hi>Clement</hi> with a wonderfull concourſe of nobilie from all parts. King <hi>Philip</hi> and his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> brother <hi>Charles</hi> were preſent, which <hi>Charles</hi> was lately returned out of Italie, and had not faintly furthered <hi>Clements</hi> election: <hi>Iohn</hi> alſo Duke of Burgondie, and many other Princes: The recourſe was ſuch, as at the entring in of the multitude a wall inſtantly falling downe many were cruſhed, amongſt whom <hi>Charles</hi> the kings brother and the Duke of Britaine were ſore hurt, and the Pope himſelfe was ouerthrowne, and his Myter ſtrucke from his head, whereof one jewell of ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable price was loſt: And all theſe things preſaged diſaſter and ruine. This made all men beleeue that he transferred the Papacie into France for ſome ſpeciall end, becauſe this new Pope at his firſt entrie created many French Cardinals, in whoſe hands lay the whole authoritie and power of election: Then on the other ſide, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that the Romans might not grow into any great diſcontent, he ſent them three Cardinals, on whom he conferred the dignitie of Senators, that ſo they might in ſome ſort ſupplie his abſence.</p>

But <hi>Henrie</hi> not attending an appointed day, paſſing the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Alpes, came into Italie, where he found many cities of the Guelphiſh faction, ill affected towards him, who had formerly bound themſelues vnto him in very ſtrict league, as alſo <hi>Robert</hi> king of Sicilia, the Popes friend, who ſupplied them with forces, to erect ſtrong garriſons where ſpeciall need did require. An armie in like manner he brought with him, to defend their league and ſocietie.

When he came to Viterbe the Clergie and people of Rome met and ſaluted him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting him honourably to Rome. At his entrie he diſcouered a conſpiracie on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> foot againſt him, and therefore for his ſecuritie he bound the Nobilitie to him by oath, and put ſufficient defenſiue forces into all the ſtrong places. Many alſo adde hereunto, That out of a new and vnknowne example he would haue exacted a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of the people on the ſame day when other Emperours contrariwiſe were woont to giue great largeſſe.

               <p>As for Church reformation, little or nothing was ſpoken at all, as ſhall appeare in the ſection enſuing.

The publike chayres and Oratories reſounded nothing all the yeare long but vaine queſtions, and meere fables; and ſo the poore ſheep being fed with the puffes of wind, pined and conſumed away: with many other things which might bee produced out of his workes, againſt the Popes Indulgences, and the abuſes of the Roman Church, the which he ſo liuely deſcribes, that one may moſt eaſily perceiue how he plainly acknowledged her to be that Whore in the Apocalyps.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Colloquium Frederici Regis &amp; Arnoldi de Villa noua.</note> 
                     <hi>that thou mayeſt ſtudie daily to obey the trueth,</hi> hee ſent for <hi>Arnold de Villa noua,</hi> who was then of great eſtimation amongſt all men, that by his aſſiſtance he might bee reſolued in his doubts. His principall doubt was this, Whether the doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell was an humane inuention, or a diuine tradition. And here three things prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally diſturbed his mind; Firſt, That the whole Clergie, as well great as ſmall, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> conformed their liues no wayes according to the Goſpell; they diſcharged ſacred offices but euen for forme ſake only, or elſe in verie mockerie &amp; ſcorne, and for the gouernement of ſoules they tooke no care, being contrariwiſe tranſported with all violence to vice and vaineglorie. Secondly, In that the Monks, who ſeemed to draw neerer to Apoſtolicall integritie, they were now ſo ſwarued and ſtrayed from the wayes of God, that in reſpect of them not onely the ſecular Clerkes, but euen lay men themſelues might rather bee juſtified, they being ſerpents and vipers, without any ſpirit of pietie. And there he deciphers them by all the notes of diſhoneſtie, by hypocriſie, impietie, crueltie, rapine, wantonneſſe, diuine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, incredulitie, and alſo about the verie Goſpell it ſelfe. Thirdly, That in a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> doctrine ſo weightie, and of ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>onſequence, he could not ſufficiently wonder at the negligence and careleſneſſe of the See Apoſtolicall. When he ſent into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers countries, he was by ſome inquiſitiue what progreſſion the Goſpell made: who returned him anſwer, They could diſcerne no ſuch matter, and that outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no courſe nor care was taken for the propagation of the Goſpell; as alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly no greater ſtudie imployed for the extinguiſhing of ſchiſmes, but rather of nouriſhing and ſetting them on fire. The Legats were daily entangled in worldlie affaires, being little carefull either for the promotion or preſeruation of the Goſpell. And conſulting with ſome Friers about his viſion, many made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:15502:242"/>
it was but an illuſion. Diuers out of this made implication, That his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> was yet in Purgatorie, and wanted prayers and ſuffrages. But <hi>Arnold de Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la noua,</hi> by many reaſons and examples, and eſpecially, in that her admonition was conſonant to the words of the Goſpell, plainely affirmed, That queſtionleſſe this viſion was of God, and thereupon exhorted him earneſtly, to ſerue God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his vocation, to performe juſtice and charitie, to prouide as well for the cauſe of the poore as of the rich; and for matters belonging to God, hee ſhould continually preferre them before all humane reſpects and conſiderations. For the doctrine of the Goſpell, that he muſt firmely auerre and beleeue, that all the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Euangeliſts is the verie doctrine of God: That Ieſus of Nazareth is the Chriſt promiſed vnto the Auncients for a Sauiour, euen God himſelf which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> created the whole world: which may be confirmed not onely out of the Articles of the Creed, but alſo by ſuch euident demonſtration as no man could oppugne or infringe: And ſetting downe the ſame in writing, he deliuered it him.</p>
                  <p>Then for the reaſons of his wauering and being in doubt, they were of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as they rather ſtrengthened the beleefe and truth thereof, than any wayes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired or weakened the ſame; eſpecially the firſt and ſecond, which touch the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prauations and corruptions of Regulars and Seculars, becauſe our Sauiour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, being the foundation of the Church, both by his owne, and by the words of his Heraulds, foretold expreſly, That this ſhould come to paſſe in thoſe times, and that not onely in the Canonicall Scriptures, but further as much hath beene <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> exhibited to vs in the reuelations of the holie Church, by many ſacred perſons of both ſex and kind, which the holie Popes with ſingular zeale and deuotion haue reſerued in ſecret Records of the Apoſtolicall See, <hi>Euen as</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I haue ſeene, and handled with theſe my hands in the ſoueraigne citie.</hi> For the third point, of the negligence and careleſneſſe of the See Apoſtolicall, That which our Sauiour Chriſt did in his owne time, and would ſhortly againe performe, might ſatisfie him: he formerly did it in that he twice commaunded, That the See Apoſtolicall ſhould be taxed <hi>with a diabolicall Apoſtaſie;</hi> firſt vnder <hi>Boniface</hi> the eighth, and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnder <hi>Benedict</hi> the eleuenth, and that ſometimes <hi>with plenitude of directory light: For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the denouncer declared, firſt, that the things he denounced proceeded not from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> himſelfe, neither was he ſtirred vp by any motiue of his owne to declare theſe things, but by the illumination and precept of the Lord of lords. And ſo he laid open vnto them both the place, time, and meanes, he meant to make choyce of in the declaration of them. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he denounced vnto them a deceitful ſnare of Sathan layd for their ſeduction, in ſo much that openly theſe two things were inculcated to them: Firſt, That they had counſellors and aſsiſtants about them, who were the Angels of Sathan, who vnder ſhew of religion, and a cloke of true zeale, ſhould endeuor to miſlead them from the ſifting &amp; clenſing of the aboue mentioned Decrees &amp; Statutes.</hi> Thirdly he declared to them, That if they <hi>ſhould neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to execute this meſſage, God would make them tast a preſagement of he eternall iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſo as it was told Boniface in writing, that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hould fall into ſuch and ſuch a danger <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and confuſion, and hee tooke no heed thereof, till he taſted the ſame: As alſo the like in writing was inſinuated to Benedict, That if hee neglected the ſame hee ſhould ſwiftly bee throwne downe from his ſeat; and from the day hee read this hee ſat not aboue fiue and thirtie dayes more: So as neither the things written to him, nor the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full euents of his predeceſſour, could moue him to beleeue, but hee contemned all things. Fourthly, for illumination and motiue, many diabolicall and abhominable deprauations were declared particularly vnto them, of many of that ſtate formerly mentioned, which is to ſay, That thoſe things aboue expreſſed were verie ſeuerally
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:15502:242"/>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> layed open; and moreouer, other things in this forme: Certaine peſtilent men diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuer and rend the Citie of the celestiall Lambe, eſpecially in the State which ſo much glories of the hight of all Euangelicall perfection; they ſubuert veritie Euangelicall, and ouerthrow the edifice thereof, in the people, not onely by peruerſe workes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, but by corruption of doctrine in their Sermons and preachings. For they prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in the deluſion, and ſubtiltie of malignitie, doe ſometimes alledge indirectly, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwhiles impertinently and peruerſly applie, and ſometimes ſophiſtically diſtinguiſh and moſt improperly expound. And thus the truth of the Scriptures was by them darkened and not clearely deliuered to the Auditors, but Gods ſayings they did adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat and falſifie. And in the ſpirit,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>of Antichriſt they endeauour to diuert the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> people from excellent ordinarie Prieſts, and to plucke the Sheepe from their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Paſtours, by ſo many meanes; and in ſuch ſort as particularly are expreſſed in the writings, reſerued to this day in the treaſurie of the See Apostolicall. Fiftly, the ſame writings obiected vnto them the diueliſh plague of the inquiſitors of that State and others: That is thoſe, who bought</hi> theſe offices in Prouinces, <hi>not for the reducing of thoſe that erred into the way, but rather that by mere calumniation and ſlaunder, they might thrust the man righteous and of good conuerſation, into the furious oppreſsions of diuels and Tyrans:</hi> where hee enueyes mightily againſt diuers coinquinations, which raigned commonly amongſt them, as alſo the frauds and deceipts wherein they maintayned themſelues: which being prolix and long, I would rather referre <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to the Reader, to peruſe them in <hi>Arnold:</hi> but yet theſe things enſuing by him proſecuted, are no wayes to be omitted: <hi>They burne and condemne the Scriptures,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as ſuperſtitious and erronious, expreſſing the veritie Euangelical, declaring the myſteries of the ſacred texts, and touching too nerely to the quicke their tranſgreſſions and vncleaneſſe, not vpon any erronious or falſe, but onely for ſome ambiguous and doubtfull ſaying. They forbid all the Colledges of that ſtate, to read or ſtudie the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd holie Scriptures, vnder payne of death, and ſo by damming vp the well of the water of life, they denie the vnderſtanding of the holie Oracles, and this water of life to thoſe that are thirſtie and crie out for the ſame.</hi> Sixtly, becauſe the Popes were by this denunciation enjoyned to reueale theſe things in the behalfe of God vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> men; which plainely appeares out of ſuch writings which the holie Fathers left both at Rome, and in the auntient Monaſteries: but they beeing wholly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with ſpirituall lethargie, would giue no eare to any good thing, or to extirpat Chriſts opprobrie on earth, but beeing bewitched as they were, made choyce rather to embrace moſt palpable and euident lies, than the myſterie of the truth and of the Goſpell. And therefore the whole Church was ſo infatuated by theſe ſeducers, as that ſhe tooke the diſordered multitude, which ſupplanted and rooted out the Goſpell, to be a Religion and Order. Seuenthly, That this denouncer, exciting the vniuerſall Church in theſe inſtigations, That ſhe would preuent the Goſpels extirpation, all notwithſtanding out of conſent and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> compact, turne aſide her eare, either condemning the meſſage, or raging againſt the Herault, That amongſt them all, not one aroſe vp, endewed with Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call veritie, armed with juſtice Euangelicall, and encouraged by the equitie and righteouſneſſe, of this celeſtiall warfare, who would ſo much as ſay, <hi>This man is zealous, for the honour and glorie of Chriſts ſpowſe, and the ſaluation of ſoules: Let vs therefore examine and diligently by experience make triall, whether thoſe things hee ſpeakes, and declares, tend to the conuerſation or corruption of the Goſpell: But the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat was all mute, and onely becauſe he reuealed the blemiſhes and defects of the ſpowſe vnto the Bride-groome (out of a zeale obſcuring and healing theſe wounds) he was
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:15502:243"/>
whipped: And they that bore the colours of Euangelicall ſanctitie, perſecuted him more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> cruelly than any other ſtrangers, not onely in renouncing the rules of equitie and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but moreouer laying apart the bridle of all humane modeſtie, they laboured to pollute innocencie, and to destroy the innocent.</hi> He concludes notwithſtanding. That <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi> ſhould in no ſort be ſcandalized with this negligence of the See Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, for theſe reaſons to make any doubt of the infallible veritie of Chriſts Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, ſeeing he himſelfe foretold as much long time before, and God had now in one ſelfe ſame time made twice denunciation thereof: and this Herauld being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily repulſed, ſcorned, and caſt into bonds, was not at all therewith ſhaken, nay, more conſtantly and firmely than euer before, he perſeuered in the Faith: <hi>For I know</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that God will yet the third time denounce his predictions to the Seat A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> but by whom, where, or when, I preciſely know not, becauſe it is not reuealed vnto me. And if this See receiues the denunciation, proſecuting it with Moſes and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas zeale, he will honour her by his diuine power, both with all auncient and new glories: but if ſhe neglect and contemne the ſame, bee aſſured that God within the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid three yeares, will bring vpon her moſt fearefull and terrible iudgements, ſuch as ſhall giue wonder and amazement to the Eaſterne and Weſterne parts, what manner of ones I will tell you before my departure in the ſence ſpirituall.</hi> And certainely much about that time grew that great and long diſcord betweene the Emperor and the Pope, <hi>Lewis</hi> of Bauaria then wearing the Diademe. But this Denouncer and Herauld, of whom mention hath beene made, was queſtionleſſe <hi>Arnoldus</hi> himſelfe, being a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> man then verie famous all Europe ouer, for the knowledge of all Tongues and Arts; who deliuering a ſpeech about Church reformation, at Rome, anſwer was returned him, Meddle in Phyſicke, and not in Diuinitie, and we will honour thee: <hi>In which words</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they endeuoured to ſeclude Chriſts little ones out of the field of Diuinitie, deſiring onely to haue this field poſſeſſed by Giants;</hi> that is, with ſuch as make warre againſt God. <hi>Frederick</hi> therefore being moued by <hi>Arnolds</hi> relations he reſolued in himſelfe verie curiouſly to ſearch out the truth of the Goſpell, to frame his life according to Chriſts doctrine, who is truth it ſelfe, and can only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on men eternall life: That he would by all labour and endeuour procure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the propagation thereof, rooting out whatſoeuer was aduerſe and oppoſit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: And he exhorted the king of Aragon his brother to doe the like, whom by letters he certified of all the proceedings; to which he likewiſe with the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and intention made anſwer.

                  <p>We alſo read an Epiſtle of king <hi>Edwards</hi> to <hi>Clement,</hi> wherein he inferres, how many kings and nobles of his kingdome, from the verie originall of the Church, had religiouſly built many Churches, liberally endowed them, and placed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in verie ſufficient and fit miniſters, ſo as the Catholike Faith might the more ſpread and encreaſe among the people and nations ſubiect to him: and by this meanes the Lords vine did wonderfully grow and ſpread; <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a thing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> much to be grieued at, the verie branches of this vine are degenerated into briers and brambles, and the wild boares of the foreſt extirpate it, and all the wild beaſts ſeed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> But if you doubt whom he meant, obſerue, <hi>While</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the impoſitions and prouiſions of the See Apoſtolike, which daily grow more burdenſome, contrarie to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of the donors, and the beſt benefices are conferred on ſtrangers, and thoſe many times verie vnworthie, and not altogether free from iuſt ſuſpition, who are not reſident in the ſayd benefices, know not the countenance of thoſe ſheepe committed to their charge, nor vnderstand not their language.</hi> And hee ſet many diſcommodities before his

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> eyes, that thereof enſued, to the vnſpeakable and wonderfull detriment of the States Temporall and Spirituall, both of Church, Kingdome, and people; ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly requeſting him, That he would forthwith remedie theſe inconueniences, becauſe ſo principall an euill was no wayes to be ſhuffled vp: <hi>The ſucceſſor</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>of the Prince of the Apoſtles receiued a commaundement from Chriſt, to feed, and not to feed vpon, the Lords ſheepe; to confirme and ſtrengthen, and not to ſuppreſſe and tread vpon, his brethren.</hi> But becauſe <hi>Clement</hi> opened not readily his ears to theſe things, <hi>Edward</hi> forbad the Annates to be conueyed out of his kingdome, as alſo that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats ſhould not goe perſonally to Rome for their ordination.

This is moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent out of the relations of <hi>Raynerius,</hi> a writer of thoſe times, who ſayth he was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> preſent both in Lombardie and other places, when they were examined by the Inquiſitors: But formerly, out of his workes, we extracted thoſe things that were pertinent to their confeſſions, that they need not here any further repetition. Concerning their manners, he writes, they were modeſt, ſimple, medling little with bargaines or contracts; to auoyd lying and deceit, liuing on their labour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing content with a little, chaſt, and ſober, inuiting others by their example to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie good thing. Moreouer, hee addes, That the firſt rules and inſtructions which for rudiments they gaue vnto their children, was the Decalogue of the Law, the ten Commaundements of God, that they ſhould learne to abſtaine from thoſe ſinnes which vulgarly were called <hi>mortalia,</hi> mortall: all which poynts haue ſmall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> coherence with the diſtaſtfull detractions impoſed vpon them by many. <hi>Clement</hi> therefore commaunded the Croſſe militar to be taken vp againſt them, expoſing theſe poore ſoules to prey and ſpoyle, proſcribing them to be ſtripped both of life and goods, and foure thouſand of them he deſtroyed, being aſſembled together in one place.

                  <hi>Nicholas</hi> the fift wonderfully promoted the Minorites, and <hi>Iohn</hi> laboured hard, according to the vſuall inconſtancie of the ſpirit of lyes, to ſuppreſſe &amp; beat them downe, and this by ſuch arguments as plainely ouerthrew the Mendicants foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: For concerning the queſtion, Whether Chriſt or his Apoſtles held any thing in proper, he ſaith, we muſt herein beleeue the holie Scripture, by which
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:15502:245"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the articles of our faith muſt be confirmed, which teacheth vs, That they poſſeſſed ſomething in proper; and therefore to beleeue otherwiſe was hereſie, and he that otherwiſe affirmed, was to be reputed an heretike. And becauſe their moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pretext was in a wilfull pouertie, he turned them to beggerie indeed, enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them to be content with meere almes: ſhewing how the cuſtome <hi>de facto,</hi> permitted to them by <hi>Nicholas</hi> the fift, with an exception of propertie reſerued to the Church of Rome, was but a plaine deluſion and couſenage, that ſo they might cunningly be exempted from that pouertie which they profeſſed: and therefore the Mendicants being driuen to beg their liuing from doore to doore, grew mightily incenſt againſt him. He further argued, That Chriſt neuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> nor aduiſed Chriſtians, to relinquiſh their goods: That hee neuer ſet downe any other rules of pietie to the Apoſtles, than to other Chriſtians, to whoſe perfection the poſſeſſion of mouables or immouables were no wayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant: That the Apoſtles neuer vowed pouertie, nor neuer out of vow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced their temporall goods, who queſtionleſſe, euen as other godlie men doe, both might and may with a good conſcience contend for temporall goods: and the naked vow was no furtherance at all to Chriſtian perfection. But to this point he grew (ſaith <hi>Auentine) That ſuch Franciſcans as now liued from hand to mouth, and begged from doore to doore, that ſpake againſt his opinion, in preaching, That Chriſt and his Apoſtles poſseſſed nothing, he condemned of impietie and pernitious errour, baniſht <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> them out of the Christian Commonwealth, called them</hi> Fraterculos, <hi>Sillie brethren; and many alſo he burned.</hi> The ſame <hi>Auentine</hi> obſerues in theſe times, <hi>That what was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly diſtributed for the ſuſtentation of the poore, was now conuerted to ornaments, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth of walls, and glorious pompe,</hi> which was out of Eccleſiaſticall goods, <hi>Then came in priuat ſacrifices, ſacrificing Prieſts, ſacrileges, pilleries, peculiarities of temples, and theſe that we call Incorporations, and Non-reſidencies,</hi> all which may be found out in the auncient Records.

And further, the Empire being deſtitute of an head, the abſolute power and prerogatiue lay in the Pope, whoſe ſee it manifeſtly is.</hi> And wee haue ſeene throughout all precedent diſcourſe, what ſtrife hath beene about this word <hi>Benefice,</hi> or Fee, as alſo how much bloud was ſhed in all parts of Italie: <hi>In

like manner when the ſeuen Electors are diuided, neither the one nor the other of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> can be king: And ſo the Roman Biſhop, as the common parent to all men, is to manage at his owne will the Roman Empire, being by ſuch a diſſention deſtitute of an head. And as the mind commaunds the bodie to ſerue, by whoſe benefit it onely liues, ſo no man can denie but that then the Chriſtian affaires goe beſt forward, when things fraile yeeld to thoſe eternall, prophane to ſacred, and thoſe corporall to the other ſpirituall: Which then comes to paſſe, when the Pope at his diſcretion gouernes both dignities; for both the the Church is gouerned, and all other power is reduced vnder his lawes and obedience. And the Emperour by oath is bound vnto him, who by a Vicegerencie vnder the celeſtiall Emperour, ſwayes and rules the earth. For this cauſe it is, that two after Henrie the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenths death, hauing beene nominated Emperours, Frederick and Lewis, both the one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and the other were incapable of this ſoueraigne dignitie, and ſo conſequently the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Commonwealth came to be diſsipated, and abandoned, and therefore in all right was to be directed and gouerned by vs. As alſo Lodouike to his owne great hurt and preiudice, and no leſſe detriment to the Roman Church, before he was thought worthie by vs to rule, out of his owne head tooke vpon him the royall Titles, raſhly vſurping the authoritie and power of Emperour, which ſtill he holds both in Italie and Germanie: For hee hath giuen into his ſonnes hands the Principalitie of Brandenburg, contrarie to all lawes: And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our oppoſition, he ſuccoured Galeazzo and his hrethren, who were condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of hereſie:</hi> (And this is continually for ſuch an hereſie as neither the Apoſtles nor the Fathers euer made mention of:) <hi>We therefore, according to the authoritie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to vs from heauen, peremptorily commaund Lewis, within the ſpace of three mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths to abiure all royal Title, and abſolutly to forbeare all gouernment, publike adminſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and managing of affaires; diſanulling all things formerly by him acted, and neuer hereafter to reaſſume the dignitie, except by our expreſſe iniunction and commaund. But if he delay any wayes in this caſe to obey, Wee commaund all Patriarches, Biſhops, Prieſts, Princes, and immunified cities, to fall from him, and forcibly to vrge him to ſubmiſsion.

                     <hi>and his chiefe Legats, Peter, Paule, Iames, and Iohn, aſcending into heauen, told vs of verie dangerous times, imminent and hanging ouer our heads, but aboue all they inſtantly admoniſhed vs, That being ſubtile in ſome ſort as ſerpents, we ſhould take heed of the leauen of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and auoid falſe Chriſts, falſe Apoſtles, and falſe Prophets, being ſo tearmed, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the lying and hollow hypocriſie of their religion, who call themſelues Chriſts Prieſts, when they are the verie meſſengers of Antichriſt: They may be diſcerned by their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable thirſt of honour, power, and worldlie treaſure, and their exceſſe auarice and pride is growne to a prouerbe. We cannot denie, but muſt cleerely confeſſe, that our times <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> can abide no ſtrict examination or cenſure: For now manners being wholly corrupted, Chriſtian ſinceritie is troden vnder foot, &amp; inured cuſtomes more preualent than truth, ouercome: but yet indignation cannot but breake ſilence, and being placed in a moſt high watch tower of diſcouerie of humane proceedings, we muſt not hold our peace, leaſt, as the holie Prophet ſayes, we ſhew our ſelues like to dumbe dogs, that cannot barke. And though we be not able vtterly to expell ſuch Wolues clad in ſheepes skinnes, yet it is our parts and dueties to reſiſt, and in ſome ſort to diſcouer them. For though we cannot doe as we would, yet our mere good will, when we can attaine no further, is both honourable and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> At laſt he applies this theame to Pope <hi>Iohn,</hi> declaring how many ſundrie waies he waſted and ſpoiled the Chriſtian Church; as he that prouoked Chriſtians <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to draw their ſwords againſt their owne bowels, and ſtirred vp nations to periurie, treacherie, rebellion, and conſpiracie: <hi>And this Antichriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>will not ſuffer vs to keep that peace recommended to vs by God, ſo great is the peruerſeneſſe of that man, or rather of Sathan, as in publike ſermons he ſets forth his owne flagitions, for ſingular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits. When Chriſtian Princes are at diſcord, then the Roman Prieſt raignes. In briefe, the Pope is then of greatest authoritie and power, when all others being weakened and pluckt downe by diſcords, ſeditions, and mutuall hatreds, his thunderings grow terrible, euerie becke of his obeyed, and wee obſerue euen his verie ſpittings, &amp;c. And queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it was by this policie that both of vs were created to the dignitie, whom a verie briefe letter from him might eaſily haue reconciled, or at leaſt haue perſuaded vs to determine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> our right, rather by iuridicall proceedings, than by armes. But contrariwiſe, he no wayes laboured to procure peace betwixt vs, but rather to nouriſh diſcord, enclining one while to mee, and then another while to my aduerſarie of Austria. Now he would be on Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dericks ſide, and then on Lodouikes partie, and which of them grew weaker, him would hee alwayes fortifie with his aydes and ſupplies. First of his owne accord hee inuited vs ſecretly to communicate, giuing faire and equiuocall ſpeeches to vs both, and being almoſt come to agreement, he would then againe perſuade vs to reaſſume armes. All this he did politically, that while we thus ruine one another with domeſtical and inteſtine wars, he might racke the Empire, demoliſh caſtles and cities, and inuade and ſpoyle both the
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:15502:248"/>
people and the Common-wealth, whoſe deſtruction he hath conſpired, reduce Christs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> flocke into ſeruitude, and fight againſt the Saints and holie ones of God. He boaſts, that he may preſently, without all delay, denounce ſentence againſt vs, before we are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: Being our capitall aduerſarie, and publique enemie, yet in his owne cauſe, he ſayes he is both ſutor, witneſſe and Iudge: The which we neuer red of amongst the Turkes, Iewes, Saracens, nor Sarmatians: Thoſe that hold their loyaltie to Caeſar, obſeruing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Chriſt our Sauiours commandement, he for no other cauſe condemnes of hereſie. What is his will, he thinkes to be lawfull: wealth purchaſeth authoritie for all things &amp;c. He aſſumes the ſpirit of Sathan, makes himſelfe like to the moſt high, is content to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped (which was forbidden Iohn from aboue by the Angell) and permits his feet to be kiſt, after the manner of Diocleſian, and Alexander, moſt cruell Tyrans: when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Christ a freeman, nay the Lord of heauen, and our God, waſhed the feet of poore fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, his diſciples, that his Apoſtles and meſſengers, by his example, might doe the like to thoſe to whom they were ſent. That there was one diuine Maieſtie, and prouidence, rich enough in it ſelfe, and needing nothing of ours, being preſent euerie where, conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and prouiding of it ſelfe for all things &amp;c. And Emperours were not conſtituted vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon earth, by fortune, chaunce, neither by mortall men, or the ſecret power of the fates, but they were choſen by ſupreameſt deitie, diuinely created, and by a moſt mercifull and indulgent Father, placed in the adminiſtration and gouernement of all humane things. Furthermore the Roman Prieſt, whoſe conuerſation ſhould be in heauen and heauenlie things, holds and poſſeſſeth Cities, Caſtles, Boroughs, Prouinces, riches, power, great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> worldlie honour and magnificence, the power of the ſword, and accruments, not out of any right of his own, but by others liberalitie &amp; benefit, that is by the beneuolence &amp; bounties, if I may not rather ſay, the vilitie and baſeneſse of the Potentates of Germanie. But they of all others moſt ingrate, studie how to deſerue ill of their benefactours; for the ſword, which through our munificence they hold in their hand, they are not aſhamed to draw and ſheath euen in our bowels, which haue beene their benefactors: now theſe goodlie Pastors, raiſed by our predeceſsours, to honour and riches, can endure no equall: They haue excluded Caeſar out of Italie, and Chriſt out of Rome: true it is they yeeld him heauen and hell, and the world they challenge to themſelues: And they will not onely be called, but firmely beleeued to be the gods of this world, and of men, as if they could rule ouer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> mens thoughts and tongues, or had an Empire equally diuided betwixt them and Ioue. Chriſt crucified, and ſupreame power on earth, are verie repugnant and oppoſit, the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier and the Priest, the Emperour and the Pastour, the Kingdome and the Croſſe, corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and ſpirituall things, armes and ſacred offices, warre and peace, Caeſar and an humble meſſenger, the Prince and the Miniſter, the Lord and the ſeruant: whoſoeuer would be greateſt amongst you (ſaith the higheſt heauenlie Arbitrator, to his Legats) let him be loweſt and your ſeruant. To be both Emperour and Pope at one time, is a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter with two heads: for in coynes and medals we ſee that Decius and Nero, with ſuch like Tyrans, then worſhippers of falſe gods, were the like. It is an abhominable reproach to nature, a great prouocation to God, and our owne mere ſlothfulneſſe, and ſtupiditie,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that the Prince of Princes, ſhould ſerue the ſeruant of ſeruants. If he be the ſeruant of Gods ſeruants, why ſerues he not? Why does he not miniſter? Why feeds he not? Why does he not teach? Why does he not preach? For greedineſſe of power and pelfe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds heauen and earth, all matters are vendible, he hath hell and heauen at commaund.</hi> Then he comes to refute the Popes Bull, by a preſident from his predeceſſours, eſpecially the prerogatiue that he ſo arrogated to himſelfe; as that in the vacancie of the Empire, and vpon the diſſenting of the electors, the gouernement of the Empire belonged to the Pope.

The head of all theſe factions is Iames de Baburco, but more truely, Cadurco, who cals himſelfe Pope: the mightie treaſure which he fraudulently amaſſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether from all the Chriſtian nations, he employes againſt the Saints of God, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects of the Chriſtian Empire, like Abiathar the Priest</hi> (who followed <hi>Abſolon</hi> againſt <hi>Dauid) conuerting the Imperiall ſword granted to vs from heauen, euen againſt our ſelues: contrarie to diuine precept be onely intends the temporall cares of this world, gapes after worldlie dominion.

The Temples, Monaſteries, and Colledges of Prieſts and Monkes, were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> pilled, burnt, and demoliſhed; ſacred virgines violently enforſt, the ſacred Hoaſt faſtened on the end of a lance, the enemie inſulting, and vſing this exprobration, Behold here the Christians God.

The principall heads were theſe, That the Pope, <hi>ex iure diuino,</hi> hath no Primacie: That <hi>Peter</hi> neuer had, nor neuer ſat at Rome, and therefore the Pope cannot haue it: That the Pope may erre, yea and the whole Roman Church, and therefore ought to be liable to a Councell. Concerning the controuerſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Pope and the Emperour, he diſcuſſeth eight ſeuerall queſtions, Firſt, Whether the Imperiall and Pontificiall dignities might be joyntly diſcharged in one man.

That <hi>Peter</hi> when he liued, as he was a man, might fall, nay, and erre; neither was the Pope by any priuiledge exempted from error.

His ſpeech hee alſo confirmed by many apt and well applied places out of the Scriptures, and the ſacred Canons; and inſiſting much vpon that text of the 22 of the Prouerbes: <hi>Exceed not the auncient bounds and limits which thy fathers layed; Becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if any customes were introduced contrarie to the ſame, they could be of no worth, nay rather they ſhould be corruptions: and Preſcription can take no place against the kings royall prerogatiue; neither can the king himſelfe renounce theſe lawes and iuriſdictions, as may be proued by many chapters which are in the tenth Diſtinction. If therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the king is ſworne at his coronation, no wayes to alienate the lawes of the kingdome, and to reuoke againe thoſe alienated, ſo if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> they ſhould be ſupprest or vſurpt by the Church or any other, he is bound to renew and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiue them againe.</hi> And with that he brought forth a ſcedule comprehending ſixtie ſix particulars, wherein were expreſſed ſuch aggrauations and oppreſſions, for which the Clergie was to make ſatisfaction. <hi>Bertram</hi> then Biſhop of Hutum be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſpeake in behalfe of the Clergie, hee ript vp the memorie of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, <hi>Lewis</hi> the Godlie, and S. <hi>Lewis,</hi> and other Pinces, who in times paſt had endowed and immunified the Churches, aduancing highly their glorie, who had augmented Church liberties; and ſo by many examples exaggerating their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and infamie, who had preiudiced and impaired the ſame: and this cauſe being referred for a day of hearing, euen to the verie feaſtiuall of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Canturburie, might fitly put the king in mind, that this <hi>Thomas</hi> as on that day ſhed his bloud for the liberties and immunities of the Church: and yet wee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly obſerued, that the Diuines of Paris diſputed how this <hi>Thomas</hi> was more probably (to be ſuppoſed) condemned, becauſe he ſuffered death for his rebellion.

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> is become a denne of vncleane theeues: And the originall of all theſe euills proceeds from one onely fountaine, though many other leſſer heads and ſprings riſe out of the ſame, from whence a raging floudgate of all manner of miſeries breakes in, wherein we cannot but pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and be ouerwhelmed in the ſurges of extreameſt miſchiefes: and if the mercie of heauen preuent not humane tranſgreſsion and enormitie, the Church doubtleſſe is like to ſuffer a moſt lamentable and fearefull ſhipwracke. How different are liues and manners, and how diſcrepant the minds of ſome that build, and others that ruine and plucke down. The Almightie God prouide ſpeedily for the ſafetie of his holie houſe.

                  <hi>CLement</hi> dying at Auignion, <hi>Stephen Albert,</hi> a Lymoſine, ſucceeded him, being nominated <hi>Innocent</hi> the ſixt.

The Pope during all this was not idle, for beſides <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillaes</hi> erecting of cittadels in all the ſtrong places of Romania, <hi>Vrban</hi> particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bent his whole ſtudie to build palaces at Oruietto, and Montefiaſcone, for the Cardinalls Tranſalpines thither to retire in time of immoderat heat; leaſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of diſtemperature of ayre, they might make this an occaſion to depart farre from the citie, whither he meant to haue reduced them, but that in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into France he died at Marſelles. Theſe things occurred in the yeare 1371, when <hi>Peter Beaufort,</hi> a Lymoſine, and nephew to <hi>Clement</hi> the ſixt, was created <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Pope, by the name of <hi>Gregorie</hi> the eleuenth. At which time Rome was gouerned by a Senator, who by the Popes order was to be changed euerie ſixt moneth: and the gard of the citie was committed to certaine Banderets, which is to ſay, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers captaines of ſeuerall wardes, or quarters, ſo tearmed of certaine Banners or Colours, which euerie one had. And this order tooke place ſince vnder <hi>Vrban</hi> the fift, certaine noble ſtrangers being preferred to the dignitie Senatoriall, as <hi>Rubeus Tiſsius,</hi> a Florentine, a Guelph, out of Prato, and Bolſena, and <hi>Boniface,</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> out of Piſtoria: which I deliuer to this end, becauſe the Banderets to the yeare 1400 poſſeſſed the greateſt part of the Roman State. Italie moreouer was euerie where tumultuous with factions, but eſpecially the Florentines made ſome ſigne of affecting libertie, whither many cities from all other parts ſent their ayd, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> not being able to maintaine themſelues, they forraged all ouer the territories of the Church. The Popes could not digeſt the Emperour neither at Rome nor in Italie: and therefore <hi>Gregorie</hi> determed to reduced againe at length his See to Rome. <hi>Blondus</hi> relates, That a Biſhop being admoniſhed by him to repayre into his owne dioceſſe, he made this anſwer, <hi>And you, holie Father, why goe you not to your owne Church?</hi> Others ſay he did this being perſuaded in reuelations, by S. <hi>Briget,</hi> and <hi>Katherine</hi> of Sienna. But when he ſaw this was dipleaſing to the French Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls, and alſo to his neere kinſmen, he cauſed a number of Tryremes to be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily built vpon the Rhodan, and ſo with ſuch as he made priuie to his reſolution,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> he was in them firſt conueyed to Genoa, from thence to Coruetto, and ſo in the yeare 1376, in the moneth of Ianuarie, he came to Rome by land. Thus after ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentie yeares continuance, his ſeat at Auignion came to an end. But <hi>Gregorie</hi> not long after dying, there began the moſt grieuous ſchiſme that euer was in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church. And at his firſt acceſſe <hi>Gregorie</hi> was entertained by the Romans with great applauſe, they ſuppoſing, that together with him wealth and riches would enter into their citie. But when <hi>Gregorie</hi> ſeemed to terrifie the whole world with his thundrings and excommunications, that he ſent forth neere at hand, &amp; among the reſt excommunicating the Florentines, by the meanes of <hi>Bernabo Viſconti,</hi> they drew thither one <hi>Iohn Haucut,</hi> and Engliſh captaine, a man of great fame for his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> martiall proweſſe, with his forces, and nothing reſpecting the Popes interdict, but contemning his cenſures, they enforced the Prieſts to celebrate ſacred offices: and the Genowayes themſelues permitted the vſe of all holie functions to thoſe Florentines which were fled into their citie, though they were generally interdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted whereſoeuer they liued; they therefore called likewiſe vpon themſelues the Popes interdict. And <hi>Bernabo,</hi> whom he held for a friend afarre off, comming nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer hand, draue <hi>Gregorie</hi> into ſome ſuſpition and jealouſie, leaſt, vnlookt for, hee might procure him one diſturbance vpon another.

And at the verie ſame time when I ſaw him ſtill kept in priſon and durance, an example thereof was related to me in the Popes palace, which he had recited to the Cardinall of Oſtia, who was commonly called of Arras, and to the Cardinall of Auxerre, who went to ſee, and confute him in his words and ſpeeches.</hi> In concluſion, That the ſame happened to the Church which in times paſt fell out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to a goodlie faire bird, who being hatched hopeleſſe of feathers, and therefore could not flie, her life was wonderfully in danger: but other birds pitying her, would haue couered her with their feathers (Kings, I meane, and Princes, confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vpon the Church many goodly inheritances and patrimonies of their owne, had enriched and honoured her aboue meaſure:) but when this bird ſaw her ſelfe ſo fledged and growne, as if ſhe wanted nothing, ſhe began to beare her head high and wax proud, fluttering and ſtriking at the others with her beke and clawes; (that was, I ſay, when the Church vndertooke warres and enmities with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours) and then the birds redemanded their feathers againe (euen as, no doubt,

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Princes will one day withdraw their gifts and benefits, ſo as at length the Church ſhould be conſtrained to craue pardon: which if ſhe did not, but returned to her former pride, the Emperour and Chriſtian Princes would at laſt take away all.) And here <hi>Froiſſart</hi> himſelfe demaunds, <hi>Why read you not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the life of S. Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſter Pope of Rome, &amp;c. how and vpon what conditions the Emperour Conſtantine gaue goods to the Church? Out of queſtion S. Sylueſter ietted not all ouer the world, being gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with two or three hundred horſe, but contained himſelfe humbly at Rome, leading a ſober and moderat life onely amongſt his Eccleſiaſticall aſſociats.</hi> Then the Frier admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them, that this change would not be long a comming: <hi>And this in ſuch a manner, as the Cardinalls were greatly amazed, and wondered at him. Faine they would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> notwithſtanding haue taken away his life, if they could but haue inuented and found out any colourable cauſe of death: but ſure there was none at all to be found, and therefore they ſuffered him to liue as long as he could, but they durſt not let him out of priſon, becauſe he propounded ſuch profound arguments, and ſearched out ſo deepe and myſticall Scriptures, as he would peraduenture haue led the world into ſome errour. In the meane while queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſſe many things came to paſſe (as many affirme that obſerued his ſpeeches more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely than I did) which he foretold and writ of during his impriſonment. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he vttered, he would alwayes confirme it out of the Apocalyps: and the true proofes wherewith he was armed for his defence, preſerued him many times from being burnt. Some Cardinals alſo there were, who ſtroke with commiſeration and pitie, were not ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and ſeuere towards him, as they might haue beene.</hi> And ſurely that Apologicall ſimilitude of his of the bird, by him recited, was moſt expreſly taken out of the Apocalyps, <hi>cap.</hi> 17. where it is ſaid,<note place="margin">

Then at length, <hi>Et habens fiduciam in pulchritudine tua, fornicata es in nomine meo,</hi> Thou haſt communicated thy ſelfe by all meanes, by ſimonie, by abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, by ſacriledges, forgetting the dayes of thy youth, thy firſt and former ſtate: <hi>Where</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it ſeemes rather an hiſtorie, than a propheſie of the Churches proſperitie. Preſently after followes the puniſhment: And behold, ſaith the Lord, I will yeeld thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of them that hate thee, and they ſhall deſtroy thy brothelrie, thy ſtones ſhall be demoliſhed; that is to ſay, the place where thou didſt exerciſe thy vnlawfull courſes: they ſhall ſtrip thee of thy garments, and take away the veſſels of thy glorie, and ſo they ſhall leaue thee naked, full of reproach and infamie. Behold</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>you may eaſily diſcerne
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:15502:265"/>
what ſhall become of the Church. And the Chapter of the propheſie addes, ſaying, Thy ſiſter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Samaria (which was the Iſraelitiſh Church) committed not halfe thy ſinnes: thou hast ſubdued her in thy wickedneſſe, wherefore beare thine owne confuſion.</hi> By the ſame meanes he applies to this argument the 23 chapter of the ſame propheſie, 2. <hi>Hoſea,</hi> 3. of <hi>Nahum,</hi> and many other places of <hi>Eſay, Ieremie,</hi> and the reſt of the Prophets. And thus he concludes, <hi>Becauſe the Prelats did not ſticke for price, entreaties, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued actions, to defame the venerable chaſtitie of the Primitiue Church, that therefore God would one day reueale his primitiue iudgements vpon this Church.</hi> It remained to expound whether the time were neere at hand or no, becauſe his text was, <hi>Iuxta eſt, &amp;c. And although</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it belongs not to vs to iudge of times, yet peraduenture by ſome infallible ſignes, which I will demonſtrat, ſome things to this purpoſe may iuſtly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> be coniectured: As</hi> firſt of all <hi>I collect out of the Apoſtle to the Theſſal.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>where he ſayes, Except a departure and falling away firſt come, the man of ſinne, the ſonne of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſhall not be reuealed</hi> (Antichriſt he meanes) <hi>which Ierome in the laſt queſtion,</hi> ad inquiſitiones Ianuarij, <hi>allegorically expounds of the deſolation of the Roman Empire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene which and the perſecution of the Church by the preſence of Antichriſt, he makes no interpoſition. Now what the preſent ſtate of that Empire is, eſpecially compared with the originall Maieſtie thereof, let any man iudge.</hi> The ſecond ſigne was, <hi>That the Church ſhould be of worſer manners and cuſtomes than euer the Synagogue was. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>reprehended the Phariſies of auarice, becauſe they permitted doues to be ſold in the Temple of God; and becauſe with their lips they onely honoured God, and what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> they ſayd and profeſſed they performed not, but were hypocrites. Doe but therefore exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether it be not worſe to ſell benefices and Sacraments, than to permit doues to bee ſold in the Temple? Here be ſome men that doe not onely, not honour God with their lips, and not onely performe no good operations, but they doe not ſo much as preach or perſuade the ſame: Dumbe dogs, not able to barke; ſhameleſſe dogs, being neuer repleniſhed. The ſhepheards themſelues haue no vnderſtanding, euerie man enclines to his owne wayes, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one to his auarice, from the higheſt to the loweſt. When he comes to his text againe. So are there alſo many, whoſe malice and inſolencie, like fire, is ſpred and kindled ſo farre, as the cloke of hypocriſie can no longer couer it: but they are become immodeſt, and braſen faced; to whoſe Church, by way of reproach, it is ſayd, Thou haſt put on an harlots brow,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> thou wilt not bluſh, nor be aſhamed.</hi> The third ſigne <hi>is taken from the proportion of two great inequalitie, becauſe one hungers and ſtarues, when another is drunke and full gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, contrarie to all iuſt harmonie and ſymetrie, &amp;c. Some Prieſts are greater than the Princes of the world, and others more abiect than the baſe vulgar. In an humane bodie, if nouriſhment defuſe it ſelfe ſuperfluouſly to one member, and the reſt pine and weare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way for want of the ſame, that bodie cannot long liue.</hi> And to this purpoſe hee doth produce ſome other places of the Prophets. The fourth ſigne is, <hi>the pride and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencie of Prelats, &amp;c. For by a natural right &amp; proportion, it is proper for Prieſts to hold and enioy ſo much as wherewith to liue more liberally than the popular ſort, and that the Prelat ſhould be maintained better than the pariſhioner: but yet for all this, they are not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> permitted any ſuperfluous equipage, or pompe and magnificence in their families, which can hardly be tollerated without pride, nor be ſuſtained with integritie of iuſtice. Such pompe and ſolemnity in the Church of God eſpecially, as is now vſed in theſe dayes, not only ſtirres vp but few to true reuerence and deuotion, but rather the contrarie, many to indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and offence; and diuers it inuites to the aboue named abuſes, who would thinke themſelues to haue ſacrificed vnto God, if they could but rob and pillage ſome fat chopling Prieſts, eſpecially of thoſe that haue neither nobilitie of birth, nor any ſcience to make ſhew of, but rather meere lying, ſeruile, and fraudulent men, to whom the Lord ſpeakes in the

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> fourth of Amos, You fat Oxen of Samaria, that offer contumelies to the needie, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen breake the hearts of the poore, Behold the day ſhall come &amp;c.</hi> The fift ſigne was, <hi>The tyrannie of rulers and gouernours, which being a thing violent, could not long be permanent: Wiſe.</hi> 6. <hi>The propertie of a tyrant, is to ſeeke not the good of his ſubiects, but of his owne: Such are thoſe ſhepheards, that feed not the Lords flocke, but themſelues, to whom it is ſayd in Ezechiel</hi> 24, <hi>Mich.</hi> 3, <hi>You hate good and loue euill, You violently flea the skin ouer their eares, and teare the fleſh from their bones: and ſo they haue eaten the fleſh of my people, and flead the skins from off their backes: The ſame ſaith Ezechiel cap.</hi> 34, <hi>I will cauſe them to ceaſe from feeding any more my flocke, for I will deliuer them from their mouthes, and they ſhall be no longer their bait and food.</hi> The ſixt ſigne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> was, <hi>The promotion of men vnworthie, and contempt of the better ſort: According to Ariſtotle, theſe things are the ſpecialleſt cauſe of the diſsolution of any politicall gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and oftentimes in a ſecular welfare it happens, that the diſhonour of men famous and meritorious, and the exaltation of the baſe and inferiour ſort, breeds great mutine and ſedition: For both in this reſpect, and becauſe of ſome of the premiſed reaſons, wee doe not onely read in Bookes, but further haue ſeene with our eyes, diuers kingdomes to haue beene almost ruined and defaced, &amp;c. But this hath alwayes beene the incredulitie of humane obſtinacie; that though they doe not onely heare, but alſo ſee it with their eyes, yet will they not beleeue others periſhed through ſuch and ſuch vyces, except they feele it by experience in the deſtruction of themſelues.</hi> The 7 ſigne was, <hi>The tribulation &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of temporall policie, with the commotion and rebellions of people, which is alreadie come to paſſe in diuers parts. And becauſe, as Seneca ſaith, euils skorn to come vnaccompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied or alone, it is to be feared, that after this, the Eccleſiasticall policie alſo, will not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffer and be repleniſhed with theſe perturbations outwardly, but alſo inwardly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the verie bowels of the Church, which is prefigured in the</hi> 3 <hi>of Ieremie, Deſolation ſhall ſuddenly come in vpon deſolation, my Tabernacles are wasted and ruined. In the</hi> 7 <hi>of Ezechiel, Tumult vpon tumult, terrour vpon terrour: and the Law ſhall faile in the Prieſt, and counſell in the Elders.</hi> The eighth ſigne was, <hi>The refuſall of correction, and amendment: when that comes to paſse, in the principall Prelats of the Church, which was writen by Ieremie, cap.</hi> 7, <hi>They would not attend nor harken, but made their hearts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of Adamant, leaſt they ſhould heare the words, which the Lord in the ſpirit vttered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, by the mouthes of his Prophets: As alſo by Eſayas, Lying children, children that would not heare the Law, who ſay, stop your eares to the words of truth; ſpeake vnto vs things pleaſing and acceptable. And this ſhall then be fulfilled, when the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats do maligne learned men and reuealers of truth, euen as it is written of them in the 5 of Amos, They hated him who reprehended them at the gates, and abhorred him that ſpake truly; and therefore to the Church of Hieruſalem, the Lord ſpeakes in the</hi> 4 <hi>of Oſee, Becauſe thou haſt reiected knowledge, I will reiect thee, ſo as thou ſhalt not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute thy Prieſthood to me, for thou haſt forgotten the Law of thy God, therefore I will change the glorie of thy ſonnes into reproach and ignominie, and euen as the people are ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſhall the Prieſt be. And ſo obſeruing well the forementioned ſignes, you may eaſily iudge whether the preſent times be ſecure, and whether thoſe doe not now take place, which the Lord deliuereth in the Text,</hi> Iuxta eſt juſticia mea, vt reueletur. He could not in more plaine and expreſſe notes, haue deſcribed the Congregation, that was to entertaine Antichriſt. It then remayned onely for him, to aunſwer certayne objections, which he omits not. <hi>There are a ſort of men,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>too confident, and affirming, that the Prelats are the Church, which the Lord will alwayes keepe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, not leauing the ſame, euen as he promiſed them in the perſons of his Apoſtles, he ſaying in the</hi> 28 <hi>of Matth. I remaine with you, euen vnto the end of the world. But
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:15502:266"/>
this is to be vnderſtood in reſpect of faith, which ſhall remaine for euer, continuing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in ſome few, though charitie and zeale wax cold, amidst all worldlie diſturbances, the which the ſame our Sauiour oftentimes preſaged and foretold. And becauſe none may ſuppoſe themſelues ſecure from tribulation, by being of the Church, the Lord refells this opinion, when he ſayth in</hi> Ierem. 7. <hi>Trust not to the words of lying and vntruth, ſaying, The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, &amp;c. which ſhall no wayes profit you. There is another opinion of thoſe that prorogue and protract Gods iudgements, for they grant, That the Church indeed ſhall be diſquieted and molested, but not ſo quickly, becauſe many reaſons haue beene heretofore touched, and other ſignes were made manifeſt; ſeeing not long ſince the Prelats were reprehended by the Doctors, Gregorie and Bernard, for receiuing of bribes, for their pompe, for promoting the vnworthie, and for ſundrie other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which then raigned in the Church, nay more than now; and yet by Gods grace it ſtill <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> remained in proſperous eſtate. God moſt fitly preuents all theſe debatements, in an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in</hi> Ezech. cap. 12. <hi>ſaying, Sonne of man, behold the houſe of Iſrael, who ſayd, The vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that this man ſaw, he hath propheſied of long time agoe: Thou ſhalt therefore tell them, ſaith the Lord, My word ſhall no longer be protracted, but I will performe it in your dayes. And in</hi> Eſay 3. <hi>We haue ſeene things come to paſſe in our dayes, which before ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med incredible: and the like hath otherwiſe happened.</hi> Others ſay, <hi>Come what come will, we will conforme our ſelues to this age, we will temporize like thoſe which ſaid in</hi> Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome 2. <hi>Let vs enioy thoſe good things that are, and repleniſh our ſelues: Such are very preiudiciall, eſpecially to good men in the Church of God. And if Eccleſiaſticall Prelats were ſo baſe as to retaine theſe bad cogitations, they could not be too deepely plunged in hel,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> &amp;c. for herein they incurre the temporall danger, which they moſt feare, the Lord ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thus vnto them in the firſt of the</hi> Prouerbs, <hi>You haue neglected all my aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and counſels, and therefore I will returne to your deſtruction, when tribulation and anguiſh ſhall euen violently ruſh in vpon you. Some diſtruſt altogether, and it ſeemes that no due remedie in this caſe can be applied: but euen as other things and former kingdoms haue had their periods, according to that of</hi> Mathew, <hi>they haue a time in the irreuocable reuolution of ages: and ſo this gouernement of the Church muſt likewiſe haue an end, the gouernours iuſt deſerts and obſtinacies requiring the ſame; as it is in the eighth of</hi> Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, <hi>There is none that repents, euerie one returnes to his owne courſe, like an horſe that violently preſſeth into the battell. If an Aethiope can change his skinne, or a Leopard his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſpots, then you may doe good, hauing learned nothing but euill: and in the ſeuenteenth chapter of Iuda, which implies the Church, The ſinne of Iuda is written with an yron penne, with the point of a Diamant; as if he ſhould ſay, it is indelible. But all theſe things pretend not impoſsibilitie, but onely difficultie, becauſe the peruerſe are hardly corrected or reformed: For in the third of</hi> Ionas <hi>it is ſayd, Who knowes whether he may be conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and acknowledge God. It is therefore ſaid in the</hi> 26 <hi>of</hi> Ieremie, <hi>Doe not withdraw the word, for it may be they will heare, and euerie one may be conuerted from his euill way.</hi> At laſt he concludes with a ſerious exhortation to repentance, conuerſion, and amendment of life. This is that <hi>Nicholaus Oremus,</hi> who by <hi>Charles</hi> the fift his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> perſuaſion, our king, and ſurnamed the Wiſe, turned the whole Bible into the French Tongue. Many copies of the ſame are to be found at this day in the libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the noble families of this land, but eſpecially there is one in the kings li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brarie, wherein <hi>Charles</hi> teſtifies by his owne hand writing, That this Bible was tranſlated by his commaundement.</p>
                  <p>And here we may fitly ſet downe, That <hi>Charles</hi> the Sage was the Author of a booke written by <hi>Alanus Charterius,</hi> his Secretarie, whoſe title was, <hi>Somnium Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridarij,</hi> The Gardens Dreame, printed at Paris aboue an hundred yeares ſince, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:15502:266"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the Papall tyrannie, both ſpirituall and temporall. That booke ſtifly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and ſo conſequently our king <hi>Charles,</hi> That the Roman Church, from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantines</hi> dayes, had obtained prioritie through a ſilent and voluntarie conſent of the Churches, not that it had any authoritie properly ouer them; as alſo becauſe there did reſide in that place many famous men, who out of their charitie were verie carefull to admoniſh brotherly the other faithfull, and theſe men againe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced their admonitions, as the rules and precepts of learned men: which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med wonderfull beneficiall and profitable. They alſo were ſubiect to their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, to preſerue the vnitie of the faithfull: and this their voluntarie obedience was in ſtead of a formall election, though no wayes, by any diuine or humane <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> lawes, they were no more tyed to the commaunds and inſtitutions of the Roman Church or the Pope, than the Pope himſelfe was to him or his Churches. And the reaſon hereof certainely was, becauſe they had not yet ouer them any ſupreme Chriſtian Prince to comprehend and keepe them within order and vnitie: the which is moſt plaine and perſpicuous, becauſe we cannot gather out of any place of the holie Scriptures, That by the commaundement of Chriſt, of any one of the Apoſtles, or of any primitiue Councell, that the Churches or Biſhops in generall were ſubiect to the Church or Biſhop of Rome, no not in thoſe things that appertaine to rites Eccleſiaſticall: Which, in no apparance, Chriſt and his Apoſtles would haue omitted, if it had concerned the ſaluation of the faithfull, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> much leſſe in that which concernes <hi>iura coactiua,</hi> lawes of conſtraint, not onely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Clerkes, but ouer ſecular Princes themſelues: the which the Popes take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, againſt the expreſſe precepts and iniunctions of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. And therefore the Church and Biſhops of Rome obtained prioritie out of the commendable ends aboue mentioned, from <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the firſt Chriſtian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, which afterwards they perſuaded the world, but moſt falſly, that they held <hi>ex iure diuino,</hi> by law diuine; further extending the ſame ouer all Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as alſo, that they are to gouerne during a vacancie in the ſeat Imperial. Which the later Popes haue preſumed to ratifie by many Decretalls, by which, out of a plenarie power, they pretend to create or depoſe kings, and they not obeying <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> their Decree in this poynt, are ſubiect to interdict and excommunication. All which propoſitions are ſharpely refuted in that booke, the Pope being reduced to theſe tearmes, That both he and the Church of Rome had no further authoritie ouer other Churches, than what by the ſame Churches was voluntarily confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon them. Hereunto let vs annex, That <hi>Edward</hi> the third, king of England, after he had oftentimes complained in vaine to the Popes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the exactions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Churches of England were continually preſſed, hee at length determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to free England from that juriſdiction which the Pope vſurped in England: Wherefore in the yeare 1374 he ordained,<note place="margin">

And for the furtherance of this ſo high a worke of Gods, he tranſlated the whole Bible into the vulgar Tongue: all thoſe heads of doctrine he deliuered to the learned in Latine, and to the ignorant in the vulgar Tongue. In publique lectures at Oxford, he was a Doctor, in ordinarie Sermons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of the Church a Paſtour, putting on a braſen forehead againſt the ſhameleſſe ſtrumpet, and a breaſt of Diamant againſt the power and violence of the whole Clergie, thundring the like euen into the eares of <hi>Edward</hi> the third then raigning in England, and he drew vnto himſelfe the attention of all the great men in the Land, which then flouriſhed eitheir in letters or armes: obtaining ſo far by his diuine labour and zeale, that truth from his mouth was harkened vnto, by many embraced and receiued, and happily preached for many yeares: ſo as that light of the Goſpell reuiued by his operations and endeauours, no puff or whirle-wind could extinguiſh, but rather it kindled vnto vs another fire all Europe ouer.

Touching the Pope, beſides the points by vs premiſed, he taught, That in the Apoſtles time there were two only orders of Clerks, thoſe were <hi>Prieſts and Deacons,</hi> for other degrees they proceeded from the pride of the Papacie: That the Pope who counterfeitly profeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be the ſeruant of Gods ſeruants, in the worke Euangelicall, was of no place or degree, but Sathans ſpeciall Atturney and procurator, that he might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually proiect and practiſe treaſon againſt Chriſt; alſo, that he was pointed at throughout all the Scriptures for Antichriſt, not his perſon ſimplie, but the chaire and Papall dignitie, from whence, by meanes of the creeping in of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe and ſenſualitie, confuſion hath inuaded the Church; how it was a moſt pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> hereſie to beleeue that euerie militant Church in Europe depended on his See and authoritie, That no man could ground out of the Scriptures, how ſuch a Vicar entred into the Church, and therefore muſt needs haue come in otherwiſe by worldly courſes and Sathans ſubtilties, That Chriſt had neuer any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to conſtitute a <hi>Caeſarian Pope,</hi> one that ſhould be both Pope and Emperour at an inſtant. And therefore it belonged to Princes ſeriouſly to ioyne both their hearts and hands, for the prohibiting of ſuch a Sathan to beare rule in the church.

                  </note> and which is more, he had made a ſermon concerning this matter, on this text, <hi>Prepare ye the way of the Lord,</hi> exhorting the Cardinalls to take paines in ſo neceſſarie a worke; ſo that hee was commonly thought to be the man <hi>by whom ſaluation ſhould be wrought in Iſrael.</hi> The ſumme of the oath, made firſt in the Conclaue, and after confirmed in the chappell <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> before God, the Virgine <hi>Marie,</hi> the holie Apoſtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and taken vpon the holie Goſpell, was this, That he that ſhould be choſen Pope, ſhould, being requeſted thereto, leaue the Popedome, prouided that the Antipope did the ſame likewiſe: That he and the Cardinals ſhould preſently after the election admoniſh all Princes to ſet to their hands to this neceſſarie worke: That in the meane time they would create no Cardinals, and would faithfully procure by all meanes, that within one yeare this ſchiſme ſhould be ended.

                  <hi>their citie, and all they had:</hi> but then ſo much the more doth <hi>Gregorie</hi> alledge his wilie ſhifts and excuſes, firſt, That the place was for him vnſafe, Genua and Sauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na being in the power of the French, and in the obedience of <hi>Benedict:</hi> which place neuertheleſſe, when the matter was debated with his nephew, was choſen, and which without doubt he had accepted of, that he might reſerue this excuſe to his vncle: and yet hereupon thoſe cities yeelded for his ſecuritie whatſoeuer could any way be demaunded. Secondly, He entreth into complot with <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> king of Hungarie, that he might defend him againſt the pretended vnion, who had about him a certaine Franciſcan Frier, guiltie of many wickedneſſes, <hi>Daemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um meridianum, A diuell of the mid-day, working the worke of darkeneſſe, who depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> not from the preſence of Errorius.

                  </note> To vphold his Popedome hereafter, he aduanceth to great dignities his nephewes <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Marke,</hi> and other his kinſmen, to whom hee committed the gouernement of the Prouinces and principall caſtles of the Church: ſo that hee thought not at all of giuing ouer his Pontificall robes, as he had promiſed.

And let the Reader here judge with what conſcience he brought in (for to ſhift off the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) ſo great a confuſion into the citie. But when the ſouldiers were diſperſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prey, and ſpared not the Nunnes themſelues, the <hi>Vrſini</hi> through deſpaire take armes, gather the people together, and ſet vpon the ambuſcado laid for them by the <hi>Colonni:</hi> in which onſet <hi>they tooke them, and led them aſhamed about the caſtle,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> wherein was encloſed that good <hi>Gregorie,</hi> whoſe deteſtable conſpiracie thereby vaniſhed to nothing.

And then to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> from him all excuſe, all the Biſhops and Abbots of Italie are rated, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded vnder moſt grieuous paines,<note place="margin">

Then he began to ſay, That hee had no
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:15502:277"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> other deſire, but that he ſaw it to be no place of ſafetie for his Court, which hee would not raſhly expoſe vnto danger: That he was reſolued to paſſe into Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardie, and there to ſtay with the Marqueſſe of Monteferrato, vntill the whole buſineſſe of the vnion were paſſed and concluded with <hi>Benedict.</hi> Therefore to draw the time in length he ſendeth to the Marqueſſe, who writeth him back, That he ſhould be welcome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and alſo for the ſetting forward of the vnion promiſeth he will leaue nothing vndone. But the warres were ſo hot in Lombardie, that there was no likelihood he would take his journey that way. His euill intention alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in this, That when the Biſhop of Tudert and <hi>Anthonie de Butrio,</hi> famous Lawyers, whom he had ſent to <hi>Benedict</hi> and to the king of France, had met him at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Sienna, and hoped for their good ſeruices to be at leaſt gratefully receiued of him, as hauing happily laboured for this pretended vnion, he caſt a frowning look vpon them, and refuſed to pay the money which they had borrowed for the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the journey: <hi>Whereat this Anthonie de Butrio went home, and ouerwhelmed with ſorrows, within a while after died.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>L.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 22.</note> In the meane time he wholly gaue himſelfe to the ſcraping together of mony on all ſides by his deputies whom he had left at Rome, <hi>not ſparing the demaines of Churches and Monaſteries, neither chalices, croſſes, candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, and other iewels of gold and ſiluer,</hi> which were euerie where ſold for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his tributes. Ninthly, The Archbiſhop of Bourdeaux, Cardinall of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquatro, a Prelat of great reputation, arriued at Sauona, where he had beene ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> receiued of <hi>Benedict,</hi> and ſeeing <hi>Gregorie</hi> the twelfth abſent, he went to Sienna with intention to perſuade him; he exhorteth him morning and euening, and can nothing preuaile. Alſo the Cardinall <hi>de Quinqueccleſijs,</hi> an Hungarian, though decrepit with age, went thither likewiſe in vaine: yea falling grieuouſly ſicke, word was brought him, That the Pope and his nephewes gaped after his mouables, <hi>and cast lots as it were on his horſes, money, and iewels: Truely</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hee ſhall neither haue me nor my goods; and without delay hauing made readie his coach, commaunded to be carried in it (though it were the depth of Winter) ſo farre as to Venice.</hi> Yet becauſe among ſo many delayes he muſt needs pretend ſome colour of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the world, by faire promiſes he winneth vnto him certaine begging Friers, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> who preach vnto the people, That with a good conſcience the vnion cannot bee made: and by their miniſterie publiſheth eighteene articles againſt the ſame,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>L.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 23.</note> 
                  <hi>That if he ſhould giue ouer his Popedome, to the end that the vnion might thereupon follow, he ſhould in ſo doing ſinne mortally, and ſhould damne his ſoule for euer to bee tormented in the paines of hell, by reaſon of the dangers of ſoules, and great hurt of bodies that might enſue thereupon.</hi> Abuſing with ſuch lyes the ſimple people. <hi>That if Gregorie and his Cardinalls and Courtiers, had gone, or ſhould goe to Sauona, they all had beene, or ſhould be the ſonnes of death.</hi> And this in the meane time whileſt ſolemne proceſſions were made at Sienna for the vnion, in which he himſelfe was preſent, <hi>couered with the cloke of hypocriſie,</hi> beſtoweth large Indulgences on ſuch as followed them, and on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> them that prayed for the ſame, in ſo much as he ſent of them into diuers nations, <hi>Beguardis,</hi> by certaine Monkes whom hee affected. Tenthly, New counſels ſeeme to giue vnto him new cauſes of delayes: He treateth with the gouernour of Luca to be receiued into the citie, that being neerer to <hi>Benedict</hi> hee may the more commodiouſly conferre with him, perſuading himſelfe that he ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, and ſo might haue a new excuſe; whereas he on the contrarie willingly yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to his requeſt. Then <hi>Gregorie</hi> requireth fiftie of the beſt families in hoſtage: an vnhoneſt requeſt, which neuertheleſſe is granted him, leaſt any thing ſhould hinder ſo neceſſarie a worke. Yet here he findeth out a new ſubtile ſhift, That he
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:15502:278"/>
would not enter into the citie, but would haue the caſtle of Pietra Santa in his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> power, <hi>which was the ſtrongeſt place of the ſayd Gouernour;</hi> which hee alſo granteth him euen without hoſtages. At length hauing no more pretences to make, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth into Luca, trifling away the time till the beginning of the month of Auguſt, all the times before aſſigned being long agoe paſt. And when the embaſſadors of Princes were inſtant with both of them on euerie ſide, they haue the ſame anſwer from each of them, That the fault is not in him that the vnion goeth not forward: in which doubtleſſe they both agreed together. <hi>Gregorie</hi> in the meane time pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatly with his Chamberlaine and his nephewes diſpoſed of all buſineſſes, for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, of Biſhopricks, Abbies, gouernements, and expeditions; although in publike he was ignorant of the things belonging to the Popedome, and ridiculous in his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſpeeches and anſwers, being woont to ſay in Conſiſtorie, That the Cardinals had conſpired againſt him to make him leaue the Popedome, to the preiudice of his obedience. Eleuenthly, <hi>Benedict</hi> was come as farre forward as Porto-venere, to the end that he might ſeeme to performe his duetie: whereupon <hi>Gregorie</hi> is by his followers with greater inſtance vrged. Then <hi>being giuen into a reprobat ſence,</hi> againſt his oath ſo oftentimes repeated, hee reſolued to create new Cardinalls, namely his nephewes, though his Cardinalls perſuade him to the contrarie, That this would be to giue <hi>Benedict</hi> ſome colourable reaſon to ſay, That hee was the cauſe that the vnion was not made; till at laſt ouercome with the importunat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of the embaſſadours of Polonia, Pruſſia, and other nations, expoſtulating <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> with him, he conſenteth to deferre the ſame for certaine weekes. And then about mid-Lent, on the <hi>Laetare</hi> Sonday, <hi>Nicholas de Luca,</hi> a Carmelite Frier, durſt preach againſt him euen in his preſence; whom about the euening, in the ſight of all the embaſſadours, he commaunded to be carried to priſon, from which he was hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at their earneſt requeſts at length deliuered, yet on this condition, That hee ſhould preach no more:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 25.</note> neither durſt any man thenceforth goe vp into the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, vnleſſe with reſolution to pleaſe his eares. Many Biſhops alſo, leaſt they ſhould communicate with him at Eaſter, ſome one way ſome another withdrew themſelues from him; yea many embaſſadours returned into their countries: ſo that, leaſt he ſhould altogether loſe his dignitie, he determined at length for once <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to write backe an anſwer to the letters of <hi>Benedict:</hi> There he complaineth, That <hi>Benedict</hi> had drawne the time out ſo long, by being obſtinat in retaining ſtill the place of Sauona (ſo that you would ſay, that there were great wrong done him) and offereth to meet him, if he pleaſe, at Piſa. <hi>Benedict</hi> on the contrarie, in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſheweth, That he was proceeded as far as to Porto-venere, that therefore <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> might come ſo farre as to Pietra Sancta, a towne vnder his obedience, where the Lord of Luca promiſed to giue him his onely ſonne, ſome of his neere kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and fortie citizens beſides, for hoſtage: That for his part hee had offered to commit himſelfe to the faith of his countreymen the Venetians, and many other things, which would haue cut off all delay: And that whereas now he maketh to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> him a new motion of Piſa, without ſpecifying any aſſurance for him, he could not yet reſolue of it, but ſent in the meane time his Legats, wel informed of his intent, who might with <hi>Gregorie</hi> and the Lord of Luca determine of the whole buſineſſe. The reſolution of <hi>Gregorie</hi> was at laſt, after many tergiuerſations, That both of them ſhould requeſt the Florentines by their embaſſadours, to aſſigne vnto them a ſafe and fit place, becauſe that at the requeſt of one of them alone they would not eaſily doe it. But during theſe delayes <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> king of Hungarie, by the counſell of <hi>Gregorie,</hi> is receiued into Rome by <hi>Paul Vrſini</hi> gouernour of the citie,
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:15502:278"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and maketh himſelfe Lord of the Citie, which was the cauſe, that on the one ſide he held the Popedome the more aſſured, becauſe he had the ſeat thereof in his power; and on the other ſide, it prepared a readie excuſe for him to returne to Rome to take order about it. For that this was done by this politique deuiſe, is manifeſt euen out of this, that his followers triumphing as of a thing well done, could not refrain from making dances for joy, euen in his palace. Twelftly, <hi>Gregorie</hi> therefore taketh no more paynes for a place to ſet forward the vnion, being now aſſured to breake it off by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Ladiſlaus;</hi> and ſo returning to his nature, againſt his oath, and notwithſtanding any thing that the Lord of Luca objected againſt it, he created foure new Cardinals,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 31.</note> and added vnto them a kinſman of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his, for to bind the ſaid Lord vnto him: And when the Cardinal refuſed, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſome biſhops and auditors of the Rota to ſit and aſſiſt him therein; theſe were <hi>Anthonie</hi> his Chamberlaine, and <hi>Gabriel Gondemar,</hi> his nephewes, a protono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie of Vdena, and one <hi>Iohn</hi> a Dominicke Frier, one of them that preached at Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ena by his commaundement, <hi>That with a good conſcience and without the damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his ſoule, he could not conſent to the vnion.</hi> The old Cardinals laboured to get away from him, but he chargeth them vnder moſt grieuous paynes, that they ſhould not depart; yea, if <hi>the regent of Luca</hi> had not by his wiſedome prouided for them, their perſons had bin in no ſafetie. But the Cardinall of Liege, a man of a great ſpirit, in diſguiſe eſcaped from Luca, and got to Piſa; yet being diſcouered <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> by ſome ſeruants of <hi>Gregorie,</hi> he continued there not without great danger of his life. In like manner all the reſt by little and litle ſteale away, being moued neither with his promiſes nor threats, from which they publiquely appeale, and ſolemne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifie the ſame vnto him ſitting in conſiſtorie amiddeſt his new Cardinals. The Cardinall of Liege, firſt maketh knowne to the world by his Letters,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 33. <hi>&amp;</hi> 34.</note> 
                  <hi>That God ought rather to be obeyed; for if</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Pope commaund or would conſtraine to ſuch things as tend to the deſtruction of ſoules, it is moſt manifest that he ought not be obeyed, neither by diuine nor humane right; yea and that man meriteth, who for not obaying in ſuch a caſe doth ſuffer his ſeuere cenſures.</hi> And thus haue wee now a two-fold Schiſme, of <hi>Benedict</hi> againſt <hi>Gregorie,</hi> and of <hi>Gregorie</hi> againſt his owne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Cardinals.</p>
               <p>Now vpon this departure of the Cardinals from <hi>Gregorie, Benedict</hi> making vſe of this occaſion, objecteth vnto him his craftie ſleights, which at length hath burſt forth into ſo euill an iſſue. Whereupon, hee withdrew himſelfe into the countrie of Arragon, where he was borne, ſeeing there was no more hope of the vnion. But <hi>Gregorie,</hi> ſeeing him departed, and being not yet wearie of deceiuing, aſſigneth a Councell at Aquileia, and to ſtrengthen the ſame, createth againe new Cardinals; whileſt on the other ſide <hi>Benedict</hi> appointeth likewiſe his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel in Arragon: Both of them euer vnder pretence of vnion, but which neither of both deſireth, both laboring to aſſure thereby the Popedome to himſelfe alone: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Which, part of the Cardinals of <hi>Benedict</hi> perceiuing, they find meanes to eſcape away from him and come to Piſa.

deadly Owle, the meſſenger (as they ſay) euer of death or calamitie, comming forth of her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> lurking holes, ſuddenly with a horrible voyce flew and ſat vpon the middle beame of the Temple, with her eyes directly fixed on Balthaſar. All began to wonder, that this night-bird which ſhunneth the light, was come in full day light into the middest of a companie, and not without cauſe tooke this prodigie for a preſage of euill lucke. Behold, ſaid they, with a low voyce one to another, the ſpirit is preſent in forme of an Owle. And whilest they beheld Balthaſar and one another, they could hardly refraine themſelues from laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Balthaſar himſelfe, vpon whom onely the Owle had bent the ſight of her eyes, bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſhame, began to ſweat, to be troubled in mind, and to burne within himſelfe, and at length, not finding any other meanes whereby to helpe himſelfe from this confuſion, he brake vp the Councell, roſe and departed. There followed afterward a ſecond Seſsion, in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> which againe in like manner as before, the Owle failed not to come (without being called I beleeue) turning her ſight euer towards Balthaſar; who ſeeing her come againe, was with good cauſe troubled with greater ſhame than before, and not being able to endure her looke any longer, he commaunded ſhe ſhould be driuen away with frighting clamours, and with ſtaues; but ſhe would not be feared neither with ſhowts nor other diſquietings, till being grieuouſly ſtricken many blowes with ſtaues, ſhe fell downe dead in the ſight of them all. This</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I learned from a faithfull friend of mine, who in thoſe dayes came directly from Rome, and being adiured by me with all vehemencie, when by reaſon of the rareneſſe I had begun to doubt of the matter, he confirmed the things he had vttered to be moſt true. He added alſo, That all they that were preſent there were brought into great contempt and deriſion of this Councell, and by little and little the whole Councell <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> being diſsipated, nothing fruitfull was there at all enacted.</hi> But they thinke it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently prouided for, when they cauſed this place and the like to be quite raced out of bookes, yea whole bookes, according to their accuſtomed good faith. In the meane time <hi>Benedict</hi> and <hi>Gregorie</hi> retained ſtill on both ſides the Papall dignitie, notwithſtanding their condemnation, the one at Rimino in Romania, the other at Perpignan in the frontire of Spaine, each accompanied with their Cardinals, and vpholden by the Princes aboue mentioned: and all Chriſtendome was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding wearie of ſo long a ſchiſme, whereunto after ſo many yeares they had in vaine ſought remedie in the Councell of Piſa. Wherefore the Emperour <hi>Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> vndertooke to call a Councell, and the better to induce all Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to embrace the ſame, he taketh paynes to ride about almoſt all Europe, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit them in perſon, that by communicating his mind vnto them, he might remoue out of the way the difficulties that might hinder ſo great a worke.

And ſo it manifeſtly appeareth in thoſe books that were drawne of the donations made vnto the Church by the Emperours and kings of Rome, and are ſtill kept in the Apoſtolike treaſurie, or chamber.</hi> That from the pompe of theſe temporall dominions ſprung the neglect of ſpirituall things, tyrannie ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered ſtrength, and diuiſions in one and the ſame Church encreaſed. Againſt which <hi>Otho</hi> quickly prouided a remedie, extinguiſhing the two ſchiſmes at Rome, whereof the one part had ſeiſed vpon the Capitoll, the other the caſtle S. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which hauing beſieged and taken, he cut off the heads of the principall of thoſe factions, and in a Councell approuing the one of theſe competitors, he tooke the other with him into Saxonie. It was not then obiected vnto him, <hi>That the Popes might not be iudged but by God himſelfe.

For it is manifeſt how much it ſtandeth all Chriſtians vpon, that the Pope be a man of pure conuerſation, no ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacall or bloudie perſon, no adulterer, dice-player, drunkard, hunter, leacher, or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like whoremaſter</hi> (he toucheth the Popes vlcers of thoſe times) <hi>for who, knowing the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Pope to be ſuch a one, can without remorſe of conſcience, or the ſinne of flatterie, kiſſe his hands or his feet, or with a good heart call him holie Father? &amp;c. Neither is the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour or king of Romans bound to keepe his oath or fidelitie giuen to a wicked Pope, or other Eccleſiaſticall Prelat, that is a notorious and incorrigible offender: For where abuſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth, all power ceaſeth, and an oath muſt be no hand of iniquitie: for otherwiſe it must follow that an oath binding, no man can hinder ſuch as are wicked and peruerſe, or admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them to returne into the right way; which is contrarie to all law and reaſon, &amp; hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the Commonwealth. Becauſe not to withſtand the courſe of the wicked when wee can, is to encourage them in their ſinne; and that errour which is not reſiſted, ſeemes to be approued. Neither doth that which the Canoniſts affirme, contradict it, That the Pope,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> except he wander from the faith, may be depoſed, That no man can iudge the firſt and higheſt ſeat, or take away that authoritie and power which he cannot giue. From hence they would inferre, that none but God can or may iudge the Pope, becauſe the Popedome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth all dignities, being the Vicar of God, and iudging the whole world: Whereas theſe Maximes in a ſuppoſed Pope, and in theſe times of ſchiſmes, are not in force, nor can with reaſon be ſo vnderſtood in an vndoubted Pope ſcandalizing the Church, becauſe he cannot be truely and properly called the Vicar of Chriſt, that keepeth not Chriſt his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor followeth his example, to the great detriment of all Chriſtendome: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

For he that wandereth from reaſon is not to be accounted a man, but an vnreaſonable creature. And the Pope being ſuch a one, ſeemes rather a tyran than the Miniſter of God, and therefere for his demerit is contemned of all, and remoued, as vnworthie, from ſo holie a gouernement, becauſe a wicked Prieſt is not ſayd to be a Prieſt, and a wicked Biſhop is no Biſhop. This is proued true out of the Goſpell, where it is conditionally ſayd vnto Peter, If thou loue me feed my ſheepe, whereby it is inferred that he that loues not God, that is to ſay, a ſimonicall perſon, an adulterer, or otherwiſe a publique incorrigible offender, deſerues not to be, neither is the true ſhepheard of the ſheepe, but a mercinarie, or a Wolfe, becauſe hee exerciſeth not the office of a good an true ſhepheard, and therefore may, and ought to be iudged by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>

And yet the Romans at that time murmuring hereat, becauſe they feared they ſhould thereby looſe that gaine they hoped for by the Iubilie, he anſwereth them ingeniouſly, <hi>My ſonnes, aſſure your ſelues I will continue Pope, and whatſoeuer theſe kings ſhall determine, I will neuer ſtand

Whereupon our Nobles and Prelats aſſembled at Paris, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neuertheleſſe the king, out of his wiſedome, thought it not good to call the Archbiſhops of Rheimes, Rouen, and Sens, becauſe the Pope had many wayes bound them vnto him.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> within his palace. His Cardinals almoſt all ſtudied how to ſatisfie the king, and ſo did the citizens of Auignon: but he perſiſting ſtill obſtinat, told them their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was ſtrong, that he would ſend for the king of Arragon to his ayd, <hi>who he knew would come to ſerue him,</hi> being bound therunto both by propinquitie in bloud, and that obedience which he did owe vnto the Pope: and that they were frighted with ſmall matters.

                  <p>There was, in the moneth of Auguſt following, another aſſemblie touching the ſame matter, where the Chauncellor of France was preſident, all theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and great perſonages aſſiſting as before.

But in the meane time (ſaith <hi>Monstrelet) Maſter Sanctien, and the meſſenger of Peter de Luna (Benedict) who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> had brought the letters before mentioned to the king, both Arragonians, being both mytred, and attired with habillaments wherin the armes of Peter de Luna were painted vpſide down, were drawne out of the Louvre vpon a ſled, into the court of the Palace: where, neere the marble pillar that is next the ſtaires, there was a Scaffold built, whereupon they were ſet to be ſeene of all that would behold them; and on their myters there was written, Theſe are diſloyall to the Church and King.</hi> The day after, there was a Councell held againe in the Palace, where Maſter <hi>Vrſinus Taluenda,</hi> Doctour of Diuinitie, ſpake for the Vniuerſitie of Paris, and tooke his Theame out of the 122.

And if the Pope or his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Legats, ſhall conſtrain any man by eccleſiaſtical cenſure to pay them, that it ſhold be lawfull to appeale from them to a generall Councell. And if any of the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors ſhall goe about to exact them, they are to be puniſhed with the loſſe of their goods, if they haue any, if not, with impriſonment.

The Munday following, there was called a royall Councell, where the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> deliuered vnto them, That what he demaunded, was due to the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like chamber by law Diuine, canon, ciuile, and naturall, <hi>which, whomſoeuer ſhould denie to pay, was no Chriſtian.</hi> Let the Reader here note, the definition of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. The Rector interrupting him affirmed, That theſe words were pronounced to the diſhonour of the king, and the Vniuerſitie, and conſequently of the whole realme. Wherefore, the thirtieth of Nouember, he called a generall congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein it was agreed to ſend Orators to the king, to requeſt that the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat might be commaunded to reuoke his words, and if he ſhould refuſe to doe it, that then the profeſſours, graduats of Diuinitie and Law, ſhould write againſt him, <hi>vpon the Articles of the faith,</hi> That both he and his Colleagues might accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to their deſart be puniſhed. That they would likewiſe write to all other Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities and Prelats to ioyne with them in this controuerſie, and to the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rheimes likewiſe, and others of the kings grand Councell to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, who haue bin ſworne to the ſayd Vniuerſitie; otherwiſe, to be depriued that dignitie. Whereupon the Popes Legats departed without taking their leaue. Neuertheleſſe the Pope is nothing at all herewith diſcomfited, but ſendeth his Legats againe to the king to require the Tenths impoſed vpon Fraunce, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in the kings Councell, the duke of Aquitan being preſent, That not only the Church of Fraunce, but all others whatſoeuer were bound to this ſubſidie,
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:15502:288"/>
not onely by the poſitiue law, but alſo by the law of God. The Vniuerſitie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it, and in a congregation concluded, That the manner in demaunding this ſubſidie was to be reproued as vniuſt, and contrarie to the law before made in the yeare 1406, which they were reſolued to defend. And if the Pope or his Legats ſhould proceed any farther, that they would then appeale to the generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the Church: and if the gouernours of the new king and kingdome ſhould attempt any thing againſt the ſayd law, they would appeale to the king and the Lords of his Councell.

In all which they humbly beſeech the Lords of the Parliament, and the kings Proctors, to yeeld them their helping hand, and to joyne with them.

                  <p>There flouriſhed in theſe times the Cardinall <hi>Zabarella,</hi> a famous Lawyer,<note place="margin">Zabarella de ſchiſmate circa annum <hi>1406.</hi>
                     </note> who writ of ſchiſme: he feareth not to ſay, That the defenders of the Pope had ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the Canon law with their Gloſſes, that there was nothing ſo vnlawfull, which they thought not lawfull for them to doe, in ſo much <hi>that they extolled him aboue God himſelfe, making him more than God.</hi> From whence ſprang infinit errors, the Pope chalenging vnto himſelfe a right ouer all inferior Churches, and making ſmall account of all inferiour Prelats: in ſo much (ſaith he) <hi>that if God giue not his helping hand to the preſent ſtate of the Catholike Church, it is in danger of an vtter ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw.</hi> But at the next Councell it ſhall be neceſſarie to reſtraine this power, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to confine it to that which is lawfull, ſince it is a power ſubiect to that of the Church (as it appeares in the fifteenth of the <hi>Acts</hi>) wherein, and not in him, doth the fulneſſe of power reſide, and in a generall Councell, which repreſenteth the Church. In ſo much that the Church neither can, nor euer could transferre that power in ſuch ſort to any one, but that it euer remained wholly in her ſelfe, not in the Pope, whom ſhe had euer power to depoſe. And therefore it is vaine that they commonly boaſt of, That he that is judged by the Church cannot be judged by men, but by God alone. It is in the power of the Emperor (ſaith he) to call Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, which plainely appeareth by the example of <hi>Conſtantine, Iuſtinian, Charles,</hi> who did preſide, and were chiefe Iudges ouer them, as it appeares by the firſt vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Nicene Councell, and others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where, when matters of faith were treated of, the lay people were likewiſe preſent. Neither is it lawfull for the Pope to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the calling of Councels, by the intermiſſion whereof the Church incurreth great danger, whileſt the Popes gouerne it after the manner of ſecular Princes, not Eccleſiaſticall Prelats. And that which is more, the Emperour, if hee doubt thereof, may demaund of the Pope a reaſon of his faith; and if he be accuſed of any manifeſt crime, proceed likewiſe againſt him by a courſe of law, and to depoſe him; he being the principall Aduocat and defender of the Catholike Church. As touching the pretended fulneſſe of power, he ſaith, That Saint <hi>Peter</hi> neuer had it, but that he was one of the chiefe Apoſtles and miniſters, to whom, in as much as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> he bare the perſon of the Church, the keyes were deliuered. For as well at Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och as at Rome he tooke vpon him the adminiſtration of his part or portion, no otherwiſe than the reſt did. And therefore the Pope commaunding nothing but what is juſt and lawfull, is to be obeyed: But whereas it is ſaid that he is <hi>ſolutus le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus,</hi> not ſubiect to lawes, it is to be vnderſtood of his owne lawes, and not the law of God, whereunto he is bound as well as others. We muſt therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware leaſt that honour be done vnto him, whereby we may make him equall with God, nay in any ſort to adore him, ſince S. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe would neuer endure it, but vtterly refuſed it, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. And whereas it is commonly ſaid, That the Church
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:15502:289"/>
cannot erre, he ſaith, it can no way be vnderſtood of the Pope, or of the Church of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Rome, but of the Church of Chriſt, and the congregation of the faithfull. And that euerie particular member of the Church is bound to be carefull for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of the Catholike faith. And this he ſaith he hath preſumed to write in this manifeſt danger of the Church, moued onely with a zeale of God and his glorie, and not any hope or expectation of reward.</p>

And as for that place of Saint Auguſtine, which you alledge, &amp;c. I ſhould not beleeue the Goſpell if the authoritie of the Church did not compell me. Truely it ſeemes ſtrange at the first view, that he ſhould ſeeme to preferre the authoritie of the Church trauelling vpon the earth, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> before the authoritie of the Goſpell, ſince in many things that may be deceiued, this neuer; and that the authoritie of the Church, as touching the root and foundation thereof, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts principally of the Goſpell: neither can the inſtitution, power, edification thereof, be drawne from any other, ſo expreſly and certainely, as from the Goſpell; eſpecially ſince Paul himſelfe ſaith thereof, If an Angell from heauen preach vnto you otherwiſe, let him be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed: otherwiſe, that is, a contrarie Goſpell.</hi> He therefore anſwereth, That S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> neuer thought any ſuch thing, but was to deale with the Maniches, who had their Scriptures proper to themſelues, and receiued not ours. As if he ſhould ſay, <hi>It is not out of mine owne particular iudgement, that I receiue the Goſpell for Canonicall Scripture, but the authoritie of the Church which hath acknowledged it to be ſuch:</hi> That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> is to ſay, of the Primitiue and Apoſtolike Church, which hath appointed the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the Scriptures, ſome of thoſe being yet liuing that writ them, Apoſtles, Euangeliſts, Diſciples of the Apoſtles, who could giue teſtimonie to the truth of theſe Scriptures, that this or that man was the Author of this or that booke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directed by the ſpirit of God; which being inſpired from aboue, ought to be the rule of our faith and Church. <hi>To be briefe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thou art not ignorant, that both Chriſt our Law-maker, and his Apoſtles preaching the law and faith vnto vs, alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged many times their proofes out of the old Teſtament, and the ſayings of the Fathers and Prophets, to confirme their owne: than which we can propoſe vnto our ſelues no example more certaine for our imitation, ſince his actions are a most infallible inſtruction of our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> manners and actions, &amp;c. And therefore it is not their parts who hold the Councell, by a certaine bolneſſe and libertie to doe what pleaſeth them; to thinke with themſelues, Wee are the generall Councell, let vs carrie our ſelues boldly, we cannot erre. They that were at the Councel of Piſa defined, and cauſed it to be publiſhed, That they, by a new election, at the instance of certaine ambitious men, had taken away the ſchiſme, and reſtored the peace of the Church. And yet who is ſo blind in the Church, that by experience of things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently ſeeth not how much this opinion deceiued both themſelues &amp; the whole Church?</hi> For (ſaith he) of what kind of men for the moſt part doe Councels conſiſt? doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of Lawyers (Canoniſts) rather than Diuines, <hi>of temporal perſons, whoſe care is of the things of this world,</hi> not ſpirituall. How then canſt thou hope for a reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of the Church from them? <hi>If then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they aſſemble themſelues for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie of the temporall peace of the Church, there is no neceſsitie that we ſhould preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeue that they are come together in the name of Christ: First, becauſe they know not whether it be expedient for the health of the Church, and that Chriſt hath determined by this meanes to heale this diuiſion. For what elſe are temporall afflictions wherewith the Church is oppreſsed, but bitter potions and medicines, whereby temporal auarice, pride, and wantonneſſe, is beaten downe? And who will ſay, that they are aſſembled in the name of Chriſt, who with this mind ſeeke the vnitie of the Church? who neuertheleſſe are ſo many that they can hardly be numbred. Theſe carcall ſonnes of the Church doe not onely
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:15502:290"/>
not care for ſpirituall things, nor haue any feeling of them, but perſecute thoſe that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to the ſpirit, as ſince the time of iuſt Abel, whom carnall Kaine murdered, it hath euer beene, and will be to the worlds end. Theſe are they who for temporall commodities flie to the Church, and liuing like ſecular men, couet and ſcrape, and rob, deſiring to beare rule, but not to ſerue, glorying in their ſuperioritie, oppreſsing their inferiours, reioycing in their owne pride and luxurie. They account gaine godlineſſe, and are alwayes readie to doe and endure whatſoeuer for the encreaſe of their temporalties, howſoeuer they are gotten; ſcorning and laughing at thoſe that are willing to liue iuſtly, holily, chaſtly, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently, ſpiritually. To be briefe, they thinke none other learned men to be profitable to the Church, but ſuch as haue learnt profitable ſciences: With ſuch the Church at this day is full, that almost in euerie Chapter and Colledge none other can hardly be found. Since <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> therefore no other are accounted in theſe dayes wiſe in the Church, but theſe temporall perſons, and all things are ſwayed according to their diſpoſition, if any are to be ſent ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Court of Rome, or of any other ſecular Princes, or to the Councell, in hope of greater preferment, after which they gape by fauours and interceſsions, with great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie they labour to be ſent. For what doe theſe temporall men but ſeeke for temporall things, thinke of temporall gaine? Can we thinke that ſuch will endeuour the reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church in manners and diſcipline, and honeſtie of life, who thinke that reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion their greateſt calamitie, and deſire nothing ſo much as that it may be lawful for them to doe whatſoeuer pleaſeth them freely, without feare of puniſhment, &amp;c.</hi> And here hee deſcribe them at large. But what concludes he hereupon? <hi>Truely ſince the Prophet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſaith, Vpon whom ſhall my ſpirit reſt but vpon the humble, and him that trembleth at my words,</hi> wee muſt not looke that theſe Councels ſhould be ruled by the ſpirit of God, where the Decrees depend vpon voyces, where for the moſt part carnall, ambitious, contentious perſons, puffed vp with vaine knowledge, where ſubiects ill prepared to receiue the ſpirit of God, where the workes of the fleſh, contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, emulations, clamors, beare ſway: ſince it is ſayd quite contrarie, <hi>The eyes of the Lord are vpon the righteous:</hi> Yea ſince our auncient Fathers when they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to celebrat a Councell, to the end they might the better obtain the aſſiſtance of Gods ſpirit therein, prepared themſelues, with prayer, faſting, teares, contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heart, humilitie of ſpirit, ſearching and inquiring into the verie inward parts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of their ſelues, leaſt they ſhould offend any way therein, that might auert his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and whereby he ſhould not ſpeake more in them than they themſelues. <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they had by experience found, that they could not be deceiued in thoſe matters for which they were aſsembled, what need was there of ſuch diligence? &amp;c. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole congregation aſſembled doth many times depend vpon the voyce and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one man, why, as that one man may be deceiued in his iudgement, may not likewiſe the whole multitude; eſpecially if out of humane preſumption, or any other grieuous crime, it deſerue to be deceiued? Is it not onely proper vnto God to doe all things rightly, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to be deceiued?</hi> But thou replieſt (ſaith he) That in that the Councell cannot erre, it proceedeth not from humane infirmitie, but the power of the holie Ghoſt.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                     <hi>Doe thou tell me againe, how thou knowest that the holie Ghoſt will alwayes giue his aſstſtance to the greateſt part, &amp;c. eſpecially ſince the greateſt part is commonly the worſe, &amp;c. In the Councell of Achab the holie Prophet of the Lord, Micha, was preſent, who without feare ſpake that which the ſpirit of God ſuggeſted vnto him, but yet could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade nothing with the king, and the reſt of the falſe Prophets, who ſpake out of their own ſpirit and vnderstanding, &amp;c. Read in the Propheſie of Ieremiah what the Lord ſpake of his Temple, againſt thoſe who falſely perſuaded themſelues that God would neuer forſake it for their iniquities. Trust not in lying words, ſaying, It is the Temple of the Lord, &amp;c.

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Therefore this houſe is made a denne of theeues, whereupon my name is called before your eyes, Behold what I did to Shilo for the wickedneſſe of my people: Now therefore becauſe ye haue done all theſe workes, and haue not heard me, I will doe vnto this houſe wherein ye truſt, as I haue done vnto Shilo, and I will caſt you out of my ſight, &amp;c. Now what is the Temple of the Lord, but the Church of God? For notwithſtanding theſe things were ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the Iewes, and written for them, yet according to the Apoſtolicall tradition, in a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure they are ſpoken to Chriſtians. But perhaps thou wilt yet ſay, That promiſes of God can neuer faile, where he hath bound himſelfe to bee with his Church to the end of the world. I confeſſe indeed, that God can neuer faile of his promiſe; but where and with whom he is, by grace in his Church, it is not for vs, but for him to know. God knoweth</hi> (ſaith <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the Apoſtle) <hi>who are his, but we, how ſhould we know it? The Church by grace may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in one ſimple woman, as it is ſayd to be in the Virgine onely at the time of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Hath a Councell of Biſhops in theſe times a greater authoritie and prerogatiue than the congregation of the Apoſtles, who all declined and went aſtray? Nay hath it a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prerogatiue than the whole militant Church, which S.

What other cauſe can wee thinke there was, why thoſe foure Councels, the Nicene, Conſtantinopolitan, firſt Epheſine, and that of Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are accounted more holy, and had a greater veneration than the reſt, but becauſe they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> were aſſemblies of holie men, and ſuch as came thither were ſo accounted, and therefore in them, and by them God manifeſted his holie will, &amp;c.

                     <hi>That we are to flie out of Babylon, according to the admonition giuen in both Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaments,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> thou confeſſeſt; but thou wilt not haue that flight to bee vnderſtood corporally, changing the place, but ſpiritually, not imitating the corrupt manners of the wicked. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is not amiſse, but it ſufficeth not for a full reſolution of this queſtion. We ſee the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch Abraham was commaunded to depart out of his owne countrey, and from his kindred and fathers houſe, not onely in affection, but effect too; yea his bodily departure is firſt commaunded, and then he is enioyned to withdraw his verie mind and thoughts from it too. Lot, after he receiued a commaund to goe out of Sodome, becauſe he was back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſlow in doing it, he was taken by the Angels and drawne forth with a kind of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence. The people of Iſrael were not commaunded to goe out of Aegypt, becauſe it was not in their libertie to doe it, becauſe of their grieuous oppreſsion; but by the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of God giuen to Moſes, and by the ministerie of Moſes obeying God, they were led forth with a ſtrong hand, not onely by a departure of affections, but by a March on foot too. Now by the circumſtance of theſe places, it is eaſie to note for what cauſes this was done. Abraham was commaunded to goe forth of Chaldea, wherein he was borne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the inhabitants of the countrey were Idolaters: Lot was conſtrained to goe out of Sodome, becauſe they were wicked men, and that hee might eſcape that deſtruction that hung ouer their heads for their ſinnes: The Hebrewes were led out of Aegypt by Moſes and Aaron, not onely becauſe of that intollerable ſeruitude they endured in their bodies, but much more for the ſaluation of their ſoules, becauſe the Aegyptians were giuen to vaine ſuperſtitions, and it was not there lawfull for the Iſraelites to ſacrifice vnto the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Lord. And therefore in theſe words of our Lord, ſo often repeated by Moſes to Pharao by his commaundement, this cauſe is openly expreſt, Let my people goe, that they may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice vnto me. I doe not thinke therefore thou wilt denie, except thou wilt openly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the Scriptures, that wee muſt depart out of Babylon not onely with our liues and conuerſations, but with our feet too; ſince that there, with ſound manners, with integritie of conſcience, with the obſeruation of the commaundements of God, it is not lawfull to liue; and least we being altogether vnable to reſist the corrupt and wicked maners of the Babylonians, violently carrying all things headlong with them, they put vpon vs their manners. The nature of man by it owne corruption is prone vnto euill, and good men are more eaſily drawne into errour by the wicked, than the manners of the wicked mended by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the good. Vice, be it neuer ſo pernitious and dangerous, by little and little growes into cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, and whileſt it ſtealingly creeps into vs, it growes and encreaſeth. Errours when they are made publike change their names, and take vpon them the laudible titles of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and wiſedome. For to omit thoſe grieuous ſinnes which a man may not lawfully name, (but yet is lawfull for God to puniſh with his vengeance) behold rapine and robberie by a publike impunitie, are not accounted vices, which vntill now were woont to be puniſhed with death. Now who is he that can liue there in health, ſound and free, where not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things vniuſt are permitted, but where a man is conſtrained by all ſorts of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the moſt cruell that may be, to beleeue, to ſay, to follow, to embrace as iuſt and laudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that which is moſt vniuſt, moſt wicked? Who can be ſober, who would not abhorre to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> liue where all are madde? Who can be ſo confident vpon his owne ſtrength, that he ſhould hope in the middeſt of the fire not to burne, or in the middeſt of a ſhipwracke not to bee drowned? But perhaps thou wilt ſay, That the furnace of Babylon burnes onely the kings miniſters, not the children of God. Let that man boldly applie that historie to himſelfe, that is like to thoſe holie children, that may with reaſon expect that God ſhould bridle the force of a fire ſo furious and conſuming, to preſerue him. The furnace of Babylon burnt onely the miniſters that kindled it. Conſider diligently whether they are of the number of theſe ministers, that put fire to the furnace, that are conſtrained to conſent, to follow, to
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:15502:291"/>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> approue the things that belong to the kindling thereof, and that dare not reſiſt it when they would, which whoſoeuer doe, to vſe the words of the Apoſtle, are worthie of death, not onely they that doe them, but they that conſent to thoſe that doe them. God was afeard of faithfull Abraham leaſt he ſhould be burnt in Vr, a citie of the Chaldees; for then as thou ſeeſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the fire was alreadie kindled. He was afeard of holie Lot, leaſt he ſhould be corrupted with the companie of the wicked, and ſo ſhould be partaker of their deſtruction: And yet we in the midſt of the furnace of Babylon, burning aboue woonted meaſure, ſecure our ſelues from all daunger, and flatter our ſelues with the deliuerie of the three children; as if the caſe were all one with vs, that as the flame of the burning furnace was extinguiſhed with the dew of heauen that it could not offend them, ſo no flame of euill concupiſcence, no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſparke of wickedneſſe, no heat of publique errour, no furie of violence, no fire of licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and euill custome, in the midst of the conflagration of all wickedneſſe, can touch vs. Turne ouer the whole Canonicall Hiſtorie, and thou ſhalt not find that God hath euer poured downe his vengeance vpon any Babylonicall Congregation of wicked men, but that firſt conſulting with the righteous, if any were amongst them, he ſeperated them from the wicked, not onely in their owne heartie deſires, but the place too, leaſt beeing co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with the wicked, as it were vnder the ſame roofe, they ſhould periſh in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. When all fleſh by ſinne being corrupted, the whole world was to periſh by an inundation of waters, God firſt commaunded Noah to build the Arke, and ſo to ſeperate himſelfe with ſome ſmall number of thoſe that belonged vnto him, from thoſe ſinners <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that were to periſh in the floud, that they might be ſaued. Lot as I ſayd before being led by the miniſtration of Angels out of Sodom, which was to be conſumed with fire from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, before that tempeſt of fire ſhould fall, for feare leaſt he ſhould periſh with the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they ſaid vnto him, Make haſt to ſaue thy ſelfe in the mountaine, for I can do nothing vntill thou come there. The people of Iſraell were deliuered from the tyrannie of the Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and had paſſed the Sea on drie foot, before the Aegyptians were ouerwhelmed in the red Sea. Before Dathan and Abiron and the reſt of their confederats were ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vp in the bottomleſse gulfe, the earth opening vnder them, Moſes ſayd to the rest of the people that were innocent of that conſpiracie, Depart from the Tabernacles of theſe wicked men, and touch nothing that belongs vnto them, leaſt you be entangled in their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſinnes. When Saule by the commaundement of the Lord was to deſtroy Amaleck, and the Kenites, friends to that people, were remaining amongst the Amalekites, Saule ſaid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, Goe, depart and get you downe from among the Amalekites, leaſt I deſtroy you with them, for yee ſhewed mercie to all the children of Iſraell when they came vp from Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt. To conclude, old Tobias dying in the ſinfull citie of Niniuie, hauing called vnto him young Tobias his ſonne, and his children, ſaid vnto them, The deſtruction of Niniuie is at hand, for the word of the Lord ſhall ſurely come to poſſe; Heare me therefore my ſonnes and ſtay not heere, but ſo ſoone as you haue buried your mother by me, prepare your ſelues to be gone from this place, for I ſee that the wickedneſſe of this Citie will haſten her end. Do not therfore ſo reſtrain thoſe things, that in the book of God are either done or comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to be done to a miſtical vnderſtanding, that they be altogether vaine and vnprofitable as touching the imitation of the Hiſtorie. That flight wherewith the Prophet Ieremie, and the Euangeliſt S. Iohn exhort to go out of Babylon, thou ſaieſt is not to be vnderſtood of the feet, but of the affections. I confeſſe with thee that we may ſo vnderſtand it without abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie; but how dost thou proue that it may not be vnderſtood of a local departure? Thou wilt ſay perhaps, becauſe there is no place where Babylon is not, There is no Citie that is not drunken with the cup of Babylon. Tell me I pray you, haue you trauelled through all places, haue you ſeene all Cities, that you can giue ſo abſolute a ſentence of euerie corner? Take heed how by one certain place known to your ſelfe, you meaſure others which you haue not
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:15502:292"/>
ſeene. If the crie of any place, or of the ſinnes thereof ſhall aſcend to the eares of God, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> call for vengeance, for which cauſe God ſhall afflict that Prouince or Citie, dooſt thou therefore thinke that he will poure downe the like vengeance vpon other Prouinces and Cities? Dooſt thou not thinke that there remaines among the reſt, ſome little Zoar, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Lot flying the furie of the fire may be ſaued? They whom God hath purpoſed to ſaue in any grieuous affliction, are commaunded ſometimes to flie to their enemies countries, as in the</hi> 16 <hi>of the Propheſie of Eſaiah, he ſaith to Moab, Let my baniſhed dwell with thee Moab, be thou their couert from the face of the deſtroyer. To be briefe, our Sauiour himſelfe did flie from the face of cruell Herod, thirſting for his bloud, into Aegypt an auntient enemie to his people, there in a ſafe corner attending the death of that cruell perſecutor; he confirming by his owne example, what he was afterward to giue in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to his Diſciples. If they ſhall perſecute you in one citie, flie into another. And leaſt, ſeeking occaſion not to flie, they ſhould anſwer, That there were no cities to which they could retire themſelues: See how he taketh away this excuſe, Verely I ſay vnto you, that you ſhall not goe to all the cities of Iſraell vntill the ſonne of man come: plainely inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating thereby, that there ſhould be alwaies cities, dedicated to the honour of his name, vnto which in times of perſecution they might flie, vntill he ſhould come at the laſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now what perſecution is more to be auoyded than that which conſtraines men to doe that which is wicked, execrable, and contrarie to the law of God, to good maners, to the instructions of our holie Fathers? And againe, the commandement of our Sauiour, as it not to be applied hereunto? whereby he impoſeth vpon all Preachers, that if they ſhall come <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to preach in any citie, that will not receiue their meſſage, they ſhould preſently depart from thence, ſhaking the duſt off their feet, that they might depart from thence pure and free from all pollution, no way defiled with the companie and conuerſation of the wicked. Now he that commaunds this of ſuch a place, what doost thou thinke he would haue ſaid of that, wherein not onely ſound doctrine is not receiued, but where ſuch are cruelly perſecuted as contradict their wills, yea rather their madneſse? What wilt thou doe there, where if thou propoſe any thing that is good, no man will obay it? And if any man commit any wickedneſse, thou ſhalt bee conſtrained to imitate it; where if thou giue a ſound iudgement of any thing, they will ſay thou art beſides thy ſelfe; if thou bee furious and madd, they will thinke thee wiſe; and if thou withſtand <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the violence of their peruerſneſſe, thou ſhalt get vnto thy ſelfe without any other fruit, an implacable hatred, with the daunger of thy life. What is it to bee made drunken with the cup of Babylon, but by a long conuerſation there, to bee ſo infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the contagion of Babylon, as following the wandring multitude, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace falſhood for trueth, vice for vertue, follie for wiſedome, like madd men; and to chuſe rather to bee a foole with the enraged multitude, than to bee wiſe alone with mockerie and daunger? For whereas thou ſayeſt, That that man flieth from Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, according to the exhortation of the Prophet, who lyuing in the middeſt of a wicked and peruerſe Nation, differeth neuertheleſse from them in his life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation: Know that this flight ſuffiſeth, ſo long as the force of the furie compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> not a man to wickedneſſe, and ſo long as Gods mercie tollerateth the ſinnes of the place, not yet growne to their full height of corruption. But where their state is deſperate, and past hope of amendement, they admit no counſell, no remedie, no whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome helpe whatſoeuer, but refuſing to be cured, they rage like madd men, and from all parts they ſend vp a continuall crie vnto God for the deſtruction of that place: who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer therefore he bee that abideth long time in that place, and feareth not that venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God that hangeth ouer that place, how different ſoeuer hee be in manners, hee is madd. Neither is it lawfull for him that differeth in manners to liue there, where
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:15502:292"/>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the plague of corruption is growne to that ſtrength, that all are infected with the contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, eſpecially the cure being remedileſſe. Is he different in manners, that hauing drunke of the cup of Babylon, beene corrupted with her poyſon, polluted with her ſinnes, carried with her rage, is conſtrained to appproue with commendation, conſent, imitation, thoſe things that are done by wicked men, not daring to open his mouth to the contrarie, or to oppoſe himſelfe with any freedome of conſcience? Thou askest whither thou canst goe where thou ſhalt not find a confuſed Babylon, and thou ſeeſt no quiet reſting place, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented abode for a peaceable mind: as if Babylon were not in thy mind too. For what mind canſt thou euer make me inſtance of, ſo peaceable ſetled and contented, in which, I will not ſay ſometimes, or often, but euerie day and houre, there is not ſome iarre, ſome conflict, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> wherein the tempeſtuous ſtormes of perturbations doe not ariſe, which the bluſtering winds of pride doe toſſe, the murmuring noyſe of diuers paſsions doth not diſquiet, and wherein there are not many times horrible and furious tempeſts; in ſo much that it is needfull for vs daily to crie out, Lord ſaue vs, we periſh.

Neither would I haue you to thinke, that according to the maner of Orators, I relate vnto you euerie particular circumſtance of this buſineſſe, for it were too tedious, and a worke of many dayes: I will onely touch ſome principall places, whereby <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> you may in ſome ſort vnderſtand the learning of the man. This Hierome being charged with many matters which tended to hereſie, and thoſe confirmed by witneſſe, it was at the laſt determined,</hi> placuit, <hi>that he ſhould anſwer publikely to euerie poynt that was obiected againſt him. Being therefore brought before the aſſemblie, and commaunded to anſwer to ſuch poynts as were obiected; a long time he refuſed to doe it, alledging that hee was first to plead his owne cauſe, before he anſwered to the falſe accuſations of his aduerſaries: but this condition being denied him, ſtanding in the middle of the aſſemblie, What iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is this (ſaith he) that hauing lyen for three hundred and ſixtie dayes in priſon, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:15502:295"/>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in ſtench, in fetters, and want of all earthly comforts whatſoeuer, in all which time you haue heard my aduerſaries ſpeake againſt me, and yet you will not now ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to ſpeake one houre for my ſelfe? Hence it is that whileſt euerie mans eares are open vnto them, to heare in ſo long a time, whatſoeuer may perſuade that I am an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike, an enemie of the faith, a perſecutor of Eccleſiasticall perſons, and ſhut againſt me, whereby I haue no meanes to defend my ſelfe, that you haue concluded me to bee an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike, in your owne conceipts, before you know what I am. And yet notwithſtanding all this yee are but men, and not gods, not perpetuall, but mortall, ſuch as can ſtumble and fall, and erre, be deceiued, be ſeduced, &amp;c. In the end it was decreed, that firſt he ſhould anſwer to thoſe errours that were obiected againſt him, and afterwards he ſhould haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> leaue to ſpeake what he would. There were read therefore out of the pulpet all the heads of his accuſation, which were likewiſe confirmed by witneſses: Then it was demaunded whether he had any thing to obiect. It is incredible to be ſpoken how cunningly he aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, with what arguments he defended himſelfe: He neuer ſpake any thing vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie a good man, inſomuch that if he thought that in his heart which he profeſſed in words, there could not be found in him any iuſt cauſe of death, or of the least or lighteſt offence. He affirmed all to be falſe, and that they were all crimes deuiſed againſt him, by thoſe that hated him. But by and by, the cauſe, for the multitude and weight of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which could not be determined in one day, was put off for three dayes longer. At which time the arguments of euerie crime being recited, and by many witneſses affirmed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> he ariſing: Foraſmuch (ſaith he) as you haue with ſuch diligence heard mine aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, it is right and conuenient that with indifferent minds yee likewiſe heare me ſpeake. Which after much adoe being graunted vnto him, he first began with praier vnto God, that he would be pleaſed to giue him that mind, and that facultie of ſpeech, that might redownd to the ſaluation of his owne ſoule. And then: I know ſaith hee, many excellent men, that haue ſuffered many things vnworthie their vertues, oppreſſed by falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, condemned by vniuſt Iudges, &amp;c. And againe, it is an vniuſt thing that a Prieſt ſhould be condemned by a Priest; and yet this was vniuſtly done by the Colledge and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Prieſts, &amp;c. All mens minds were moued and bent to mercie; For he added, that he came of his owne accord to the Councell, to purge himſelfe, and to giue a reaſon of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> life, and of his ſtudies and endeauours, &amp;c. That the moſt learned and wiſest men of the world in matters of faith, were many times of diuers opinions, not to ouerthrow the faith, but to find the trueth: That Auguſtine and Hierome had diſcented, and contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted one the other in diuers things, without ſuſpition of hereſie. All men did expect that he would purge himſelfe, either by reuoking that which was obiected, or by asking par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for his errours: But he doing neither the one nor the other, fell into the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Iohn Hus, condemned to the fire, calling him a good and a holie man, and vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of that death; and that he for his part was readie with a valiant and conſtant mind to vndergoe any puniſhment, and to yeeld himſelfe into the hands of his aduerſaries, and thoſe impudent lying witneſses that were brought forth againſt him, who neuertheleſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> were one day to yeeld an account vnto God, whom they could not deceiue. But this</hi> (ſaith <hi>Poggius) is an admirable argument of his memorie; For three hundred and ſixtie daies together he was in the bottome of a ſtinking and deepe dungeon, the miſerie of which puniſhment himſelfe complaineth of, affirming as it became a good and a valiant man, that he was not therefore grieued therewith, for that he had ſuffered things ſo baſe and vnworthie, but rather wondred at their inhumanitie against him; in which place he could neither read nor ſee. I omit the griefe of mind wherewith hee must needs bee troubled, which a man would thinke, ſhould haue vtterly ouerthrowne his memorie; and yet notwithſtanding all this, he alledged ſo many learned Doctors of the Church, to
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:15502:296"/>
make good his opinion, that it had beene ynough, and more than ynough, if he had liued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> at eaſe, and with a quiet and conſtant mind had giuen himſelfe to the ſtudie of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and knowledge, &amp;c. He was void of all feare, not onely contemning death, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring it; that you would haue ſayd he had beene another Cato. O man worthie the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall memorie of men. I prayſe him not, if he held any opinions againſt the Church</hi> (hee ſpeaking ſtill doubtfully) <hi>but I admire his learning, his knowledge in all things, his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, his ſweet deliuerie, his dexteritie in anſwering. But I feare leaſt all theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent gifts of nature haue beene giuen him to his owne ruine.</hi> This is the ſtile of <hi>Poggi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us. There were in the end two dayes allowed him to repent. Many men verie learned came vnto him, to diſſuade him from his opinion, among others the Cardinall of Florence; but he continuing obſtinat in his errours, the Councell condemned him to the fire for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> hereſie. He went to his death with a ioyfull and pleaſant countenance: he feared not the fire, nor the kind of torment, nor death itſelfe. Neuer was any Stoicke of ſo ſetled a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, or with ſo valiant a mind ſuffered death, as this man ſeemed to deſire it. When he came to the place of death, he put off his apparell, and then falling downe vpon his knees, he kiſſed the ſtake to which he was bound.</hi> And here he repeats the particular circumſtances. <hi>When the fire was ſet vnto him he began to ſing a certaine Hymne, or Pſalme, being hardly interrupted with ſmoke or flame, which was an excellent token of his conſtant courage. When the executioner would haue put the fire to him behind his backe, that he might not ſee it, Come hither (ſaith he) and kindle it in my ſight, for if I had feared it I would neuer haue come to this place, which I had power to haue auoyded. In <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> this manner this man, rare and excellent beyond all beleefe, was conſumed to aſhes. I haue ſeene his end, conſidered all his actions: Whether he did it by treacherie or obſtinacie,</hi> (otherwiſe it was dangerous to ſpeake) <hi>you might haue placed the death of this man among thoſe that came forth of the ſchole of Philoſophie: For neither Mutius with ſo conſtant a reſolution endured the burning of one member, as he the whole bodie; neither did Socrates ſo willingly drinke poyſon, as be embrace the fire. But ynough of this.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Leonard Aretine,</hi> anſwering to his Epiſtle, ſtickes not to tell him that hee ſpake too freely: <hi>Although</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thou many times purge thy iudgement, touching the puniſhment of Hierome, yet thou bewrayeſt I know not what, of greater affection than is fitting: I thinke ſuch things ſhould bee written more aduiſedly.</hi> And yet hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> himſelfe in his Oration againſt hypocrites,<note place="margin">Leonardi Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tini Oratio con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra hypocritas.</note> calls the Monkes and Clergie of his time, hypocrites, Phariſies, proud, bloudie men, painted ſepulchres, couſeners, Preachers of dreames, &amp;c.</p>

But this Prince, otherwiſe great, either by his owne negligence, or more truely, by reaſon of pouertie, came thither in ſo poore a manner, that hee eaſily put away from him all feare. <hi>We haue ſeene him</hi> (ſaith <hi>Valla) with few followers about him, liue but as for a day, and he would haue periſhed for hunger if Eugenius had not fed him, though not gratis, for he wreſted from him the Donation. He comming to Rome to bee crowned Emperour of the Romans, could not be crowned of the Pope, but on condition that he ſhould ratifie the donation of Conſtantine, and alſo giue all thoſe things anew.</hi> Yea he addeth in indignation, <hi>What is more contrarie, than to be crowned Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and to renounce Rome? to be crowned of him, whom he confeſſeth, and (as much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> as in him lyeth) maketh Lord of the Roman Empire? and to ratifie a donation, which if it be true, leaueth to the Emperour nothing of the Empire? which I thinke children would not haue done.</hi> Yea and <hi>Eugenius</hi> adiureth him, before he ſet the Crowne on his head, preſently to depart Rome, and to ſtay no longer in Italie: and ſo hee forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with paſſed the Alpes,<note place="margin">Platina in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genio <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> and returned into Germanie. And this is it <hi>Platina</hi> hath: <hi>In the beginning of his Popedome, moued by the words of the Emperour, Princes, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats, he confirmed the Councel of Baſil, euen by his Apoſtolicall letters: for he was ſo vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with warres, that he ſcarcely had power to breath: but taking heart againe, hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and prudently adminiſtred all things.</hi> Thus ſpake hee in fauour of the Popes.</p>
               <p>Whereup <hi>Eugenius</hi> ſtoutly taketh vpon him to diſſolue this Councell, or to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne another ſomewhere elſe, and he publiſheth his Bulls, whereby he reuoketh both the Councell and Cardinall <hi>Iulian,</hi> whom he had appointed to preſide there; who ſpeedily returneth to him into Italie. The Fathers of the Councell on the contrarie, by their embaſſadours ſundrie times beſeech him, That he would come and be there preſent himſelfe, otherwiſe by diſſoluing the Councell hee would giue occaſion of ſcandall: yea they decree, That reuocation can haue no place, and ſet before him the moſt grieuous puniſhments propounded in the Councell <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of Conſtance, vnleſſe he would obey: but if he purpoſe (which he hideth) to hold another Councell, they declare openly, that there can be but onely one.

                     <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 31.34 35.</note> they ſuſpend him from the Popedome, depoſe him, pronounce him a notorious ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matike, periurer, heretike, ſcandalous, incorrigible, obſtinat, depriued, depoſed, put downe; and as ſuch a one they take from him all obedience, and make a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree for the chuſing another in his roome. All which things in their order reach <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to the yeare 1439. And theſe things were done, notwithſtanding the Emperour <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> in the meane time was deceaſed, who had chiefely ſet forward the Councell; that <hi>Eugenius</hi> alſo with his had aſſigned another Councell firſt at Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara, in the yeare 1438,<note place="margin">

In the meane time <hi>Eugenius</hi> was not idle in Italie. <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeuenth, king of France, who held for the Councell of Baſil, had ſent his gallies into the Ionicke ſea, for to meet <hi>Iohn Palaeologus,</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of the Eaſt, and to giue him to vnderſtand in what place the lawfull Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell was held, &amp; to perſuade him to take land in France, &amp; thence to conduct him to Baſil. <hi>Eugenius</hi> hauing corrupted with money the Generall of the French gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, breaketh off his courſe, and draweth him to his part. Whereupon <hi>Eugenius</hi>
                  <pb n="562" facs="tcp:15502:301"/>
taketh occaſion not a little to commend his Councell, by the hope of making an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> vnion betweene the Roman and Greeke Church, which notwithſtanding, as it ſeemed, continued not long. And ſo hauing diſmiſſed his conuenticle, he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to Rome, where he is receiued with greater applauſe than before. On the other part, the Councell of Baſil continuing ſtill neuertheleſſe, it troubled him: and truce being made betweene the kings of France and England, whereby the ſouldiers on both parts were diſmiſſed, <hi>Eugenius</hi> taketh the occaſion offered, and winneth the Dolphine of France (who was afterward <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth) who of thoſe broken troupes gathered together to the number of thirtie thouſand and more, and vnder diuers pretences marcheth towards Baſil, but indeed with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (as the Hiſtoriographers of Italie doe teſtifie) to terrifie the Fathers of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Councell for to conſtraine them to breake it off. When theſe were entred on the territorie of the citie, the Cantons of the Switzers ran to ſuccour it: There foure thouſand Switzers ſuſtained a violence and force neuer before heard of, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict that continued till night; of the Switzers, fighting it out euen to the laſt gaſpe, there hardly eſcaped an hundred and fiftie, but of the Armignacs (for ſo they were called) were ſlaine eight thouſand, among which was their chiefe Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And thus did that good Father procure the peace of the Church, which was betwixt <hi>Felix</hi> and him miſerably diſtracted; yet there were many that acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged neither. And as <hi>Felix</hi> and his fauourers, bold vpon the authoritie of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Baſil, defamed <hi>Eugenius</hi> in his Bulls: ſo he likewiſe ſpareth not <hi>Felix</hi> in his,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> written to all the Princes from Florence, That this <hi>Felix,</hi> Duke of Sauoy, borne in a countrey infamous for witches and ſorcerers, from his youth conſulted with them, had this put into his head, That he ſhould be Pope; and that to this end he had aſſumed the habit of an Hermit, for to ſet a monſtrous head on the Church, as a moſt falſe hypocrite; and that he might couer vnder ſheepes clothing his wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſh crueltie, That he truely was an Image of <hi>Nabuchadnezzar,</hi> or rather an Idol of <hi>Belzebub</hi> ſet vp in the Church of God, a <hi>Lucifer,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>I will place my ſeat in the North, &amp;c.</hi> And worſe he would haue ſaid if he could: Whileſt in the meane time in his letters and Buls he ſtileth himſelfe, <hi>The true Spouſe of the Church.</hi> What dare Antichriſt do more?

<pb n="563" facs="tcp:15502:301"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> doe it, which in the meane time he declareth to your Holineſse, that you may know in what manner you must come vnto him.

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: For when he was yet at Venice, he had ſaid to one of his domeſtike fauorites concerning the Pope, I haue determined with my ſelf, that if the Pope be of more yeares than I, I hold him for my Father, if of equall yeares, for my brother, but if he be younger than I, I account him for my ſonne: And my mind is, that if there bee any faire houſe neere vnto his, which hath <gap reason="foreign">

But when he heard of kiſsing his feet, he was amazed, notwithstanding hee departed, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> we came (when the Courts were alreadie full) to Ferrara, and ſtayed right againſt the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle neere the bridge: and before noone there came ſix Biſhops, and they in the Popes behalfe congratulat the Patriarches comming. The Patriarch ſaid, That hee owed him not any ſuch ſalutation; but for as much</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as wee are brethren, let vs embrace and kiſſe each other brotherly, otherwiſe I will doe nothing. The Patriarch had alſo other ſpeeches concerning that matter, vnto which they made anſwer.</hi> And the Patriarch, with all the Biſhops that he had brought with him, tooke counſell together, and with one voyce did decree, <hi>That this is neither iuſt nor meet, nor profitable to be done.</hi> The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of the Pope returne againe in the morning, and <hi>inſtantly vrge that kiſsing of feet; but the Patriarch declareth, this inſtance is vnſeemely: for whence</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Pope that right? ſhew vs what Synod hath giuen it to him, or where it is written, eſpecially ſeeing the Pope calleth himſelfe the ſucceſſor of Saint Peter? But the Biſhops an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That it is an auncient cuſtome of the Pope, and that all ſalute him in that manner, Biſhops, Kings, the Emperour of Germanie himſelfe, and the Cardinalls, who are greater than the Emperour, in as much as they are perſons conſecrat. Whereunto the Patriarch replied, That this was a new inuention, I will not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>aſsent vnto it, I will neuer do it; but if the Pope be pleaſed that I ſalute him brotherly, according to our auncient man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in that ſort I will goe to him; but if he accept not of that, I refuſe all, and returne back againe.</hi> At length (ſaith the Greeke Synod) it came to this, That whereas the Pope thought to haue made the Patriarch kiſſe his feet in a frequent aſſemblie, when he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> could not make him condeſcend vnto it, was forced at laſt to receiue him, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>in his priuie chamber,</hi> and that the Cardinals onely being preſent. All which things were on each ſide treated and concluded, before the Greekes would come forth of their ſhips. For the order of the Councell, the Pope contended, that the Greeke Emperour and the Patriarch, with the Orientals, ſhould ſit on the left ſide of the Temple, and the Weſterne peoples on the right hand, and that himſelfe at the higher end of all, in the middeſt betweene both, as head of both, ſhould haue an eminent ſeat: The Emperour contrariwiſe debateth, That this
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:15502:302"/>
place rather belongeth to him. At laſt they agreed, that the Pope with his We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> people ſhould ſit on the right hand, the Greeke Emperor with the Eaſterne people on the left; but <hi>Eugenius</hi> ouerruled ſo farre, that his throne was placed by the high Altar, the Roman Emperours (though abſent) in the next place, but ſome degrees lower, and equall with him ſat the Cardinals and Weſterne Prelats: the Emperour of Greece had his throne ſet right againſt the Popes, and on his left hand ſat the Patriarch of Conſtantinople, but in an inferiour degree, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall with him were the ſeats of the Legats of the other Eaſterne Patriarches, of the Archbiſhops and Prelats, euerie one in his order. And hence may the Reader diſcerne what the Patriarch might judge of the pride of the Latine Biſhop. But what may we ſay of <hi>Baronius,</hi> who in diuers places conteſteth, That the left hand <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in Councels was euer the more honourable. As touching the matter it ſelfe, for the concluding of the controuerſies of the Latine and Greeke Churches, is made an inſtrument of a vnion, <hi>Laetentur coeli,</hi> wherein they agree on both ſides, That the holie Ghoſt proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne: That the Sacrament may be indifferently made of leauened or vnleauened bread: That the ſoules of the faithfull that haue not yet ſatisfied for their ſinnes, goe to Purgatorie: That the Pope of Rome is Head of the vniuerſall Chriſtian Church. All which arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles the Greeke Emperor cauſeth to be approued by the moſt part of his, hoping he ſhould haue aſſiſtance againſt the Turkes. But <hi>Michael</hi> Biſhop of Epheſus, with ſome others, doth euer withſtand the ſame, reiecting eſpecially the two later.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Which is more, when <hi>Ioſeph</hi> Archbiſhop of Conſtantinople was dead, <hi>Eugenius</hi> would haue them proceed before him to the chuſing of another, promiſing, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his diſpoſition, to ordaine him without money, yea to giue them ſome if need were; and to depoſe him that did obtaine with him the place of Patriarch: which he would not doe if they deferred his election till they came into their countrey. The Greekes perceiuing whereto he tended, namely, that he might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter poſſeſſion of the ſupreme power in the Church by that meanes, and that with their conſent, anſwer him with one accord, That their Patriarch cannot bee, by their laws, choſen any where elſe than at Conſtantinople: That it is their cuſtom he ſhould be choſen and conſecrated in his owne Church: That the Emperour,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> who was not ignorant of theſe ceremonies, would not ſuffer it to bee otherwiſe. Which the Pope vnderſtanding,<note place="margin">Conciſium Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. Seſſ. vltim.</note> though much againſt his mind, with gracious words he let them depart. Now they were no ſooner returned into their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, but they were reiected of their Churches, in this eſpecially, that they had admitted the ſupreme authoritie of the Pope of Rome, whoſe pride being more neerely looked into, they at laſt refute it in their writings publiſhed, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that he had endeuoured to bind vnto him ſome of the beſt learned, as <hi>Iſidore</hi> Biſhop of Ruſſia, and <hi>Beſſarion</hi> Biſhop of Nicea, to whom he had giuen a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls hat, which he choſe rather to weare in Italie than in Greece. And from that time forth were by the Popes neglected the affaires of Greece, and abandoned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to the furie of Infidels.</p>
               <p>But it is in no wiſe here to be omitted, That during the time that <hi>Eugenius</hi> held his Councell, partly at Ferrara and partly at Florence, hee publiſhed diuers wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings againſt that Decree of Baſil, That a Councell is aboue the Pope, in which he did not ſticke to affirme, <hi>That ſo farre was it off that he ought to obey generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, that then he moſt merited when he contemned the Decrees of the Councell:</hi> and which is more, he declareth this propoſition to be hereticall, <hi>The Councell is aboue the Pope,</hi> although both then and euer ſince it was held and affirmed by all the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of Chriſtendome. Whence it came, that whileſt the Roman Church ſayd ſhe is ſuperior to all other Churches, and the Roman Biſhop to all other bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, by this decree of <hi>Eugenius</hi> ſhould the Biſhop of Rome be made ſuperiour or of higher authoritie than the Vniuerſall Church, and conſequently that preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded infallibilitie of the Church ſhold be deriued not now to the Romiſh Church, but to one onely man, which is the higheſt degree of Antichriſt in the Church, according to that of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his booke of the citie of God,<note place="margin">Auguſt. de Ciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Dei l. <hi>18.</hi> cap. <hi>2.</hi>

               <p>As touching the affaires of the Bohemians, for which particularly the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> had ſo inſtantly requeſted the Councell; the moſt part of the Churches, terrified with the perfidious treacherie vſed towards <hi>Iohn Hus,</hi> and <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> of Prague, refuſed to ſend any one thither: but the principall of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ouer-ruled the matter, that ſome ſhould appeare, for to render a reaſon of the innouation in religion imputed vnto them. So ſoone as they came thither, they were receiued verie curteouſly by Cardinall <hi>Iulian</hi> the Legat, who was not yet called backe. Then in the Councell he maketh an Oration, wherein he bringing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in the Church of Rome ſpeaking to them, in his words, and attributing to it ſelfe alone all that is ſpoken in holie Scripture concerning the Church the Spouſe of Chriſt, and preſuppoſing that which is chiefely in queſtion, flattereth himſelfe in this perpetual Elenche: Sheweth that in her power are the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, That ſhe is without ſpot or wrinkle, That whoſoeuer departed from her was an Heathen and a Publican, That the decrees of Councels are her decrees, which are no leſſe to be beleeued than the Goſpels, ſeeing they giue authoritie to the Scriptures. To this the Bohemians in few words; That they deſpiſed neither the Church nor Councels, that they had beene condemned at Conſtance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being heard,<note place="margin">Oratio Iulian.

The diſputation laſted fiftie dayes, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many ſpent on this ſide and on that, it was thought beſt to leaue Theologicall queſtions, and prouide for the Common wealth, and to ſend ſome thither, who hauing made ſearch how matters ſtood, might compound with them. Here was the policie, To permit the Communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder both kinds, to ſuch as in other things would ſubmit themſelues to the Councell, and proceeded with all rigour to the reſt that embraced not the ſame condition. Theſe were the auntient Waldenſes, and their Diſciples, who requeſted that the Church might be reformed in moſt of the Articles, which are conteined in their and our confeſſions; who for this cauſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſuffered much, both by the warres that <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> made vpon them, and by the diuiſion and back-ſliding of their companions: Yet doe we ſee their Churches outliue ſo many miſeries, &amp; vntill theſe times conſiſt and continue moſt flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and largely propagated. As touching the Fathers of the Councell of Baſill, they ſeeme to be ſomewhat aſhamed of that Decreee of Conſtance, concerning the Communion vnder both kinds: And whereas they of Conſtance ſayd, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Chriſt hath inſtituted the holie Supper vnder both kinds, &amp;c.

Theſe are euer their ſubtile deceits. Laſtly, this Councel of Baſil had forbidden to exact or pay Annates, vnder pain of Simonie; <hi>Eugenius,</hi> who willingly wold looſe nothing, complaineth as of an iniurie done to the Church, That this could not, neither ought to haue beene done, without hauing firſt conſulted with <hi>Eugenius</hi> and his Colledge of Cardinals,<note place="margin">Reſponſ. factae per Domin.

And this was not the leaſt cauſe why he would diſſolue the Councell.

               <p>More our the Councell of Baſill, or at leaſtwiſe they which in their name wrot againſt the Bohemians, on their part ſet forward the progreſſe of abomination. For when thoſe Churches had determined not to admit any doctrine that was not grounded on holie Scripture, Cardinal <hi>Cuſan</hi> was charged by letters to confound them with this Axiome, which they were not aſhamed to maintaine, <hi>That the Scriptures can by no meanes be of the eſſence of the Church, either begun or continued, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> but onely of the ſeemely order thereof.</hi> Item, <hi>That the Church is not knowne by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, but the Goſpell by the Church.</hi> Item, <hi>That ſo much the more worthily is the word of God giuen of God, by how much the farther off it is from all Scripture, yea and from all vocall word:</hi> That by this reaſon he might reduce all things to the Church, which they call Catholike, from the Catholike to the Roman, and at laſt draw them from the Roman to their Councell. And when thoſe Churches replied, That that was not the mind nor voyce of the auntient Church, which had otherwiſe celebrated the holie Euchariſt, and had in another ſence interpreted the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than now in theſe dayes it is:<note place="margin">Cardinal.

And when afterwards the Popes haue reduced the vniuerſall authoritie both of Councels and of the Church it ſelfe, to the perſon of the Pope alone (<hi>Eugenius</hi> in the Councell of Florence, <hi>Pius</hi> the ſecond in his eloquent bull on that matter, and others afterward) it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Pope is exalted aboue the holie Scriptures, yea aboue God himſelfe, and is therfore to be accounted for him, of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.</note>

The Preface of his diſcourſe is by a place of S. <hi>Bernard</hi> vpon the <hi>Canticles, Sermon</hi> 33. <hi>A rotten vlcer ſpreadeth it ſelfe at this day ouer all the bodie of the Church, ſo much the more deſperat, by how much the more it is farre and wide extended; and by how much the more it is inward, ſo much the more it is dangerous. For if an heretike enemie ſhould openly ariſe, he might be cast out, and ſo wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; if a violent enemie, ſhe might perhaps hide her ſelfe from him: but now whom ſhal ſhe caſt out, or from whom ſhall ſhe hide her ſelfe? All are friends, and all enemies, &amp;c. they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> are the minister of Chriſt, and ſerue Antichriſt, &amp;c. The wound of the Church is inward and incurable, &amp; therfore in peace her bitterneſse is moſt bitter.</hi> And this place haue we aboue alledged at length, out of which he draweth this concluſion, Seeing that the Church from henceforth was fallen from euill to worſe, vnleſſe betimes it be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to and preuented, after the horrible darkneſſe of ſo many ſchiſmes, much more horride things were in very few daies to be expected. He proſecuteth afterwards by degrees thoſe things that he thinketh doe belong to reformation of the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall body of the Church: Firſt, That it is neceſſarie there ſhold be eftſoons held ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and Prouinciall Councels for the correction of abuſes, eſpecially generall,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which can with greater authoritie correct both all ſorts of perſons, and all things. Neither are we to expect remedie from the Church of Rome, as if it were able to ſatisfie all caſes that fall out: <hi>Many</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſuſpect that ſhe hath diſſembled theſe things, and for this cauſe hath neglected the holding of Councels, that ſhe might the more fully beare dominion according to her owne luſt and pleaſure, and vſurpe the more freely the rights and prerogatiues of other Churches:</hi> That before the time of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Church might not with free libertie hold Councels, it hath fallen into diuers hereſies; therefore no maruell if in theſe later times, through neglect of Councels, it fall into diuers ſchiſmes, and innumerable other euils <hi>ad haereſes diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentia,</hi> which diſpoſe it to hereſies: That generall Councels are firſt of all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> for the reformation of the body of the Church,<note place="margin">Diſt. <hi>19.</hi> C.

Laſtly, that now, if euer, was a fit opportunitie, either to procure the vnion of the Greekes with the Latines, or to repreſſe the deſignements of the Turks, who after they haue rent and torne in peeces the Empire, will with all vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ruſh vpon the Church, and ſo make way for Antichriſt: <hi>And already</hi> (ſaith he)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

For the reformation of the Court of Rome: That for the auoiding of ſchiſmes, which proceed from the factions of the Cardinals, it is ſufficient to haue of euery each Prouince but one onely Cardinall: Alſo that the Pope ought to prouide remedies, &amp; cut off the grieuous burdens wherwith the Roman Church oppreſſeth other Churhces, ſeeing that the Greeke Church is alienated from it becauſe of her exactions, excommunications, and ſtatutes: and that to take away thoſe exactions, it were meet ſhe ſhould abate of her pompe, of her exceſſe, and
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:15502:304"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of the number of the Cardinals: Excommunications, which after the example of the Primitiue Church, for to make them the more to be feared, ought not come forth but for graue and weightie cauſes; whereas in theſe dayes they are thunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth for verie light and for the moſt part temporall cauſes, and the Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maes themſelues; whereupon they are growne into contempt with all men: That there be a meane vſed in Statutes, Canons, and Decrees, which oblige to mortall paines, and of which may be ſaid that of our Lord to the Phariſies, <hi>They lay burdens on mens ſhoulders, which they wold not touch with the top of the finger.</hi> And this article reached very farre. 3. For the Prelats, That they ſhould be choſen capable in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, exemplarie in manners, reſident in their charges, <hi>moderat in diet and expence, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> abſtaining from corporall armes, from ſecular affaires, cutting off all ſimonie:</hi> That it was neceſſarie to declare, that many obſeruations are of that kind, that they are rather counſels than precepts. He bringeth for example, <hi>Lent,</hi> to be moderated out of the circumſtances, the Seruice to be abridged to a deuout and entire breuitie, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of Images in Churches to be repreſſed, a meane and bounds to be ſet in new Holidayes, Churches, and Saints; on Sondayes and ſolemne feaſts onely to abſtaine from labour, and out of the Diuine Seruice to baniſh and put forth all Apocripha Scriptures, new prayers, and to be ſhort, all nouelties. 4. For religious perſons, That their great number and diuerſitie is altogether pernitious, whileſt the one boaſteth and is proud in his Rule againſt the other; aboue all, the begging <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Friers ought to be bridled, being burdenſome to the people, <hi>dammageable to ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and hoſpitals and to other truely poore and needie wretches, preiudiciall alſo to the Curats and poore of Pariſhes, and likewiſe, if it be well conſidered, to all estates of the Church: Thoſe Preaching money-gatherers aboue all, becauſe they defile the Church with their lyes, and make it ridiculous, and the office of Preaching contemptible.</hi> Monkes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Canon of Chalcedon, to be reſtrained in their monaſteries to faſtings and prayer, excluded from Eccleſiaſticall and ſecular affaires, and to be debarred from all ſtudies, Diuinitie excepted, ſeeing it is euident, <hi>That the Court of Rome, in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Diuines, haue preferred to all Eccleſiaſticall degrees the ſtudents of gainefull ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, when neuertheleſſe the Primitiue Diuines haue edified the Church, which ſome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> wrangling Lawyers haue deſtroyed, and now ſeeme to bring to extreame ruine; ſo that now this horrible prouerbe is vſed of ſome, That the Church is come to that ſtate, that it is not worthie to be gouerned by any but reprobats.</hi> Neither doe they withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from the juriſdiction of Ordinaries againſt the holie Decrees, by humane priuiledges obtained by importunitie: <hi>For it is not a little to be doubted</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>whether ſuch men are in ſtate to be ſaued.</hi> All which things, although they reſpect more the circumſtance than the ſubſtance of Chriſtian religion, yet are they in no ſort touched in that Councell. Moreouer,<note place="margin">Petrus de Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aco in Veſperijs.</note> this ſame <hi>Peter de Alliaco</hi> in his Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, hath diſputed, <hi>Vtrum Petri Eccleſia lege reguletur, Whether the Church of Peter</hi> (meaning the Roman) <hi>may be ruled by a law:</hi> where he concludeth affirmatiuely, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſubiecteth both the Pope and the Roman Church to a Councell. Yet there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not at the ſame time, euen in France it ſelfe, buſie ſpies of the Pope, who maintained contrarie poſitions; for in the yere 1429 one Frier <hi>Iohn Sarazenus,</hi> of the order of Preachers, durſt teach and maintaine theſe ſame that follow: Firſt, <hi>That all powers and iuriſdictions of the Church, which be other than the Papal power, are from the Pope himſelfe, as touching their inſtitution and collation.</hi> 2. <hi>Such like powers are not</hi> de jure diuino, <hi>of diuine right, nor immediatly inſtituted of God.</hi> 3. <hi>It is not found that Chriſt hath expreſſed ſuch powers, to wit, different from the Papall, but only that ſupreme power to whom hee hath committed the foundation of the Church.</hi> 4. <hi>When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:15502:305"/>
any Statuees are made in any Councell, the whole authoritie giuing force to thoſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Statutes, reſideth in the Pope alone. Fiftly, It is not expreſly ſhewed by the text of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, That the authoritie of iuriſdiction was beſtowed on any of the Apoſtles, ſauing one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on Peter. Sixtly, To ſay that the power of iuriſdiction of inferiour Prelats, whether they be Biſhops or Curats, is immediatly from God, like as is the Popes power, is after a a ſort repugnant to the truth. Seuenthly, Like as no flower, no bud, neither yet all flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and buds together, can doe any thing in the tree, which are all ordained for the tree, and deriued from the tree; ſo all other powers can</hi> de jure, <hi>by right doe nothing againſt the chiefe Prieſthood, or Prieſt, being inſtituted by him. (Here after is ſaid, that the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall power is the Pope, as ſayd Hugo de Sancto Victore</hi> 2 De Sacramentis: <hi>out of which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> it may ſeeme, that here by chiefe Prieſthood hee meaneth the Pope.) Eightly, That the Pope cannot commit Canonicall ſimonie, prohibited by the poſitiue law.</hi> The profeſſors of Diuinitie in Paris, being ſolemnely aſſembled on the eighth day of March, and hauing duely weighed theſe poſitions, condemne them publikely, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the ſaid <hi>Iohn</hi> to abiure them, and force him to anſwer vnto others contrarie, which here doe follow: <hi>First, That all powers of iuriſdiction of the Church, which are not the Papall power, are from Chriſt himſelfe, as touching their primarie inſtitution and collation, but from the Pope and from the Church, as touching their limitation and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall diſpenſation. Secondly, Such like powers are</hi> de jure diuino, <hi>of diuine right, and immediatly inſtituted by God. Thirdly, It is found in holie Scripture, that Chriſt hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> founded the Church, and hath expreſly ordained the powers diuers from the Papall. Fourthly, Whenſoeuer in any Councell any Statutes are made, the whole authoritie giuing vigour to the Statutes, reſideth not in the Pope alone, but principally in the holie Ghoſt, and in the Catholike Church. Fiftly, By the text of the Goſpell, and by the doctrine of the Apostles is expreſly ſhewed, That the authoritie of iuriſdiction was beſtowed on the Apoſtles, and on the Diſciples ſent of Chriſt. Sixtly, To ſay that the power of iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of inferiour Prelats, whether they be Biſhops or Curats, is immediatly from God, is conſonant to the Euangelicall and Apoſtolicall truth.

               <p>The Councell of Baſil was able perhaps to take in hand a reformation with more courage than that of Conſtance; but it had <hi>Eugenius</hi> to contend with, who, as before we haue ſeene, defended ſtoutly euen the leaſt articles, ſo that by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, gaine ſayings, and oppoſitions, he left nothing vnattempted.

<pb n="571" facs="tcp:15502:305"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> aſſembled a Parliament firſt at Norimberg, and after at Mentz, wherein were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Deputies of the Councell of Baſil, of all nations: in <hi>Eugenius</hi> name ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared none in ſhew, yet verie many in deed, who ſet forward his intention. The Fathers of Baſil conſented, that for the commoditie of the Greekes the place of the Councell ſhould be changed. <hi>Eugenius</hi> for to retaine his authoritie, would haue the Councell of Baſil bee diſſolued. In the meane betweene both was the Emperour, who would haue it ſo to be transferred, that it ſhould be thought diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued: Neuertheleſſe he found ſo much reaſon in the proceeding of them of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil, that he gaue them for Protector of the Councel <hi>Conrade de Windzberg;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he manifeſted both that he approued the Councell, and diſliked the wiles of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
                  <hi>Eugenius,</hi> namely that which the Author noteth, <hi>The embaſſadours requested that the Fathers would repaire and transferre the Councell to another place; which one thing Eugenius ſeemed to haue ſought, that ſo he might either diſperſe the Fathers of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, or take away the libertie thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During the Parliament of Mentz, was diſputed among the Diuines in the Councell of Baſil, of the perſon of <hi>Eugenius,</hi> the one part affirming, <hi>That he is an heretike,</hi> others, <hi>That he is a relapſe,</hi> and ſome denying both: <hi>the more grieuous ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence carried it away, That he was an heretike and a relapſe both together.</hi> The Diuines therefore ſet downe in writing eight Concluſions (which they call Truthes) and ſend copies of them throughout all the world, which were ſuch; <hi>Firſt, It is a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Truth of Catholike Faith, That a ſacred generall Councell hath power aboue the Pope, and all other whomſoeuer. Secondly, That a generall Councell lawfully aſſembled, cannot, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſent of the ſame, be by the Pope of Rome his authoritie, either diſſolued or tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, or prorogued for a time; and that is of the ſame Truth. Thirdly, That he which obſtinatly oppoſeth himſelfe to theſe Truthes, is to be iudged an heretike. Fourthly, Pope Eugenius the fourrh hath repugned theſe Truthes, when firſt by the fulneſſe of Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like power he attempted to diſſolue or transferre the Councell of Baſil. Fiftly, Eugenius be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at length warned by the ſacred Councell, hath reuoked the errours repugnant to theſe Truthes. Sixtly, The diſſoluing or transferring thereof, the ſecond time by Eugenius at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, is contrarie to the Truthes aforeſaid, and containeth an vnexcuſable errour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> faith. Seuenthly, Eugenius enterpriſing againe to breake vp, or transferre the Councell, is fallen into his errours formerly reuoked. Eightly, Eugenius being admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the Synod to reuoke the diſſolution or tranſlation by him attempted, for the ſecond time, perſiſting in rebellion after his contumacie declared, and erecting a conuenticle at Ferrara, declareth himſelfe obſtinat.</hi> Neuertheleſſe the Fathers would haue theſe yet publikely be examined by all the Doctors both of the Ciuile and Canon Law, for the ſpace of ſix dayes, <hi>Lewis</hi> Cardinall and Archbiſhop of Arles, ſitting Preſident, a man of great learning and courage, and they would that all ſhould ſpeake their opinion of them. The Abbot of Palermo, vulgarly called <hi>Panormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> tooke vpon him the defence of <hi>Eugenius,</hi> yet durſt not denie that hee was an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> heretike, but onely that he was a <hi>relapſe,</hi> whom he would rather ſhould be called a <hi>Prolapſe,</hi> becauſe from a <hi>relapſe</hi> is no returne. On the contrarie <hi>Iohn de Segouio,</hi> a Spaniſh Diuine of great fame, ſtifly maintaineth out of his owne ſayings, <hi>That he is an Infidell rather than a beleeuer, a member of Sathan rather than of Chriſt;</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to that ſingular Gloſſe alledged by <hi>Panormitan, That the iudgement of the Roman Church ought to be preferred before all the world,</hi> the authoritie of S. <hi>Hierome, Orbis maior eſt vrbe, The authoritie of the whole world is greater than of one onely citie.</hi> The Biſhop of Arges proceedeth, <hi>That the Pope is onely the Miniſter of the Church.

                  <hi>Take heed what thou ſayeſt,</hi> Panormitane, <hi>that is a more honourable title for the Biſhop <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of Rome, whereby he calleth himſelfe the Seruant of the ſeruants of God. For that is taken from the ſaying of Chriſt to his diſciples, when they asked which of them ſhould be the greatest; for you know that he anſwered, The Princes of the Gentiles rule as Lords ouer them, &amp;c.</hi> But the Archbiſhop of Lyons, Embaſſador of the French king, ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>proued by many reaſons, that Eugenius was an heretike, and deteſted the lacke of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of them, that had created ſuch a man Biſhop of Rome.</hi> The Biſhop of Burgos Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour for Spaine, inſiſting on the three former concluſions, concludeth out of all the Law diuine and humane, <hi>That the Councell is aboue the Pope, that he is an heretike which denieth it.</hi> But comming to other things, which properly reſpected the fact of <hi>Eugenius, It ſeemed</hi> (ſaith the Authour) <hi>that he ſomewhat departed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> from himſelfe, and was no more Burgenſis; neither did that grace appeare in his words, nor that grauitie in his ſpeech, or chearefulneſſe in his countenance, and if he could haue ſeene himſelfe, perhaps he would haue beene abaſhed at himſelfe: For who</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>did not then ſee the force of the truth, which furniſhed this man, ſpeaking for it, with ſentence and words; but ſpeaking againſt it, tooke away from him that verie eloquence which naturally was ingrafted in him? Yet thus much modeſty ſhewed both he and Panormitan, that they ſayd ingeniouſly, That the iudgement of the Diuines was to be beleeued, and not their opinion who were not inſtructed in the holie Scriptures.</hi> What Doctors of the Canon-law are theſe? what aſſeſſours or aſſiſtants of Popes and of Councels, which neglected to read the holie Scriptures.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
               </p>
               <p>The Authour proceedeth to declare, what was done vpon thoſe three conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: vpon the firſt, namely, which hath two points, <hi>Whether the Councell be aboue the Pope, and whether Catholike faith commaundeth to beleeue ſo;</hi> And for the Popes authoritie was ſolemnely cited; <hi>Thou art Peter and vpon this rocke &amp;c.</hi> Item, <hi>I haue prayed for thee Peter, &amp;c.</hi> By conference then of places, and by the expoſition of the Fathers, they manifeſtly proue, that theſe things were promiſed to the church, not to <hi>Peter,</hi> much leſſe to the Pope: and indeed, that many Popes haue grieuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly erred, and of theſe they produce examples; That the Church, which is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by a Councell, is the mother of all the faithfull, and by conſequent of the Pope, whence of <hi>Annacletus</hi> and <hi>Calixtus</hi> it is called <hi>Mother;</hi> That the Church <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> is the Spouſe of Chriſt, the Pope onely his Vicar, a Vicar, who can neuer be aboue the Spouſe, who is one bodie with the bridegroome: That theſe words euer in their mouth, maketh nothing for them, <hi>Whatſoeuer yee ſhall bind on earth, &amp;c.</hi> for this power was giuen to the Church not vnto <hi>Peter,</hi> for edification not for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, which conſequently may be taken away from the Pope, if he abuſe it, who is onely Vicar and Steward of the Church; therefore not equall to the Church, ſeeing Chriſt ſendeth Peter himſelfe to the Church, <hi>tell it</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>to the Church,</hi> which if he will not heare, he ought to be accounted an heathen and a publican: That this Church ought to be heard by the Pope, in a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell lawfully aſſembled: And that all thoſe Canoniſts, which buzze into his eare,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that the Pope cannot be iudged but by god alone, that the firſt Seat is iudged of none, that though he ſhould leade multitudes of ſoules with him into hell yet is it lawfull for none to ſay vnto him, <hi>what or why doest thou ſo;</hi> doe moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully flatter him: <hi>That thoſe decrees are the words of the Popes themſeues,</hi> labouring to enlarge the fringes of their garment: That thoſe places alſo of Scripture, <hi>Thou ſhalt be called Cephas, &amp;c. I will giue vnto thee the keyes, &amp;c. I haue prayed for thee, &amp;c. Feed my ſheepe, &amp;c. Launch forth into the deepe,</hi> and the like, are induced againſt the true meaning of the holie Scripture; which they proue both by forcible reaſons,
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:15502:306"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and by good and well applied places of the Fathers: That the Pope, if he obey not the Church, may be depoſed by it, ſeeing he is not the naturall head thereof, but grafted in, which may no leſſe be cut off than the reſt of the members, if hee ill execute his charge, if he be for the deſtruction or dammage thereof, be caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire, if he bring not forth good fruit, and be troden vnder foot in the ſtreet, if he be vnprofitable: Which is the opinion of S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> interpreting the <hi>vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſalt, That the Prelat fooliſh and vnſauorie in preaching, chiefely in Peters chaire, is to be caſt forth of doores, that is, to be depoſed, that he may be troden vnder feet of ſwine, that is, of Diuels, which beare rule ouer the euill Prelat, as ouer a beaſt of their flocke.</hi> And this not onely for hereſie, but for whatſoeuer crime whereby the Church is ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> And this ſo much the more truely, for that the Pope, to ſpeake properly, is not the Vicar of Chriſt, but of the Church; and the Lord and Maſter may by all right depoſe his Vicar or Lieutenant, whoſe power ceaſeth when the Maſter is in preſence: ſo likewiſe doth the power of the Pope when a Councell is gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, wherein remaineth fulneſſe of power. Here this doubt came in their way, <hi>But the calling of a Councell, doth it not belong to the Pope alone?</hi> Yea (ſaith he) if that haue place, who ſeeth not that the ruine of the Church is neere at hand, and will preſently enſue? For who knoweth not that hee which will ſinne, will ſinne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out puniſhment? And who wil beleeue that a Pope will aſſigne a Councell for to repreſſe and reforme himſelfe? Neither doe I find (ſaith he) either by hiſtories, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> by the Acts of the Apoſtles themſelues, that Popes alone haue aſſembled Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels: <hi>The firſt of all Councells, where Mathias is ſubſtituted in place of Iudas, I find to be gathered not by the commaundement of Peter, but of Chriſt, who commaunded his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, that they ſhould not depart from Hieruſalem, but ſhould expect the promiſe of the Father. The ſecond for the election of Deacons, was not aſſembled by Peter alone, but by the twelue Apoſtles, for it is written, Then the twelue called the multitude together. The third for the taking away of Circumciſion, and other legall rites, was gathered by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune inſpiration, as it is written, The Apoſtles and Elders came together. The fourth for the permiſsion of certaine legall things, ſeemeth to be aſsembled by Iames the brother of the Lord.</hi> The ſame was alſo in the Primitiue Church, and ſince by the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of the Emperours, yet ſo, as that the Popes conſent was requiſit according to reaſon, but on condition that the greater part carrie it away. And much more the Councell, being once aſſembled, cannot be by the Pope reuoked, ſeeing he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is a part of it, which ought to giue place to the greater; and from it to depart, maketh him guiltie of ſchiſme. And thus much for the firſt <hi>Truth,</hi> whereon the ſecond dependeth, <hi>That the Pope cannot diſſolue a Councell,</hi> otherwiſe, at the firſt word he ſhould heare of correction, he would bethinke himſelfe of this remedie. There remained the third, <hi>Whether this of Catholike faith is ſo to be beleeued:</hi> Which they ſhew affirmatiuely, becauſe we are held to beleeue whatſoeuer is in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell; now in it, ſay they, is <hi>dic Eccleſiae,</hi> on which words the Councel of Conſtance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> hath grounded this Decree, That the power of a Councell is aboue the Pope, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der paine of hereſie. And ſo theſe three firſt Concluſions reſt moſt firme, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of which the others alſo are approued.</p>
               <p>Now this deciſion was to be applied againſt <hi>Eugenius,</hi> and part of them who had conſented in theſe <hi>Truthes,</hi> deſired that the ſentence ſhould be deferred, ſome hoping they ſhould haue better of him, others, by reaſon that many Biſhops yet ſtayed in the Parliament of Mentz, famous men, whoſe Suffrages might ſeeme to be expected. And <hi>Panormitan</hi> tooke occaſion thereupon to inferre, That the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ought to be ſtayed for, and that inferiours haue not in Councell a Suffrage

                  <hi>deciſiue,</hi> but onely <hi>conſultatiue:</hi> Vnto which added <hi>Ludouicus Romanus, That argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> is not to be taken out of the Acts of the Apoſtles, whoſe examples were rather to be admired than imitated; neither is it there manifeſt, that the Apoſtles had called the Elders out of their duetie; there is onely declared that they were preſent, out of which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be inferred.</hi> Which ſpeech all wondering at in ſo great a man, crie out <hi>Blaſphemie.</hi> Then therefore <hi>Lewis</hi> Cardinall of Arles, <hi>A man of all other moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and borne to the gouernement of generall Councels, taking vp the words of all the Orators that had ſpoken,</hi> declareth, That all theſe doubts were without cauſe, That theſe Concluſions had beene maturely determined and weighed, That the embaſſadours of all the Princes had giuen vpon theſe their ſentence, which were the chiefeſt men in the Church, That the Biſhops were in fault that they were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> not preſent, That to ſuch as were preſent greater reuerence was giuen than in any Councell before, and indeed greater authoritie, for ſo much as their prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiues are fully reſtored vnto them, <hi>whom they placed in their former ſtate, and haue made them which were not Biſhops, but ſhadowes, to be true Biſhops:</hi> That euen they which now do moſt draw back, haue in their writings auouched the ſame <hi>Truthes</hi> (meaning by thoſe words of <hi>Panormitan,</hi> and <hi>Ludouicus Romanus.) But</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>the Presbiters are not ſo to be put downe, who in the Councell of the Apoſtles had a deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue voyce;</hi> and in like ſort alſo in the auncient Councels: That in time paſt the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and the Presbiter, or Prieſt, was but one and the ſame; in ſo much that S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> ſaith on theſe words, <hi>I will giue vnto thee the keyes, &amp;c. That our Lord gaue</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> judiciariam poteſtatem, <hi>iudiciarie power</hi> to Biſhops and Prieſts, <hi>eſpecially ſeeing they haue more done their duetie in the Councell than the Biſhops;</hi> theſe fearing to loſe their dignities and their delights, thoſe for ſo juſt a cauſe not dreading any loſſe, nor yet death it ſelfe: That the Councell hath now ſat eight yeares, ſo that there cannot be pretended any headlong proceeding, nor any ignorance. And moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, the threats of ſome Princes are inferred beſide the Purpoſe, who are wiſer than to attempt any thing in preiudice of the Councell; and they themſelues al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo being taught by the word of God, not to feare them that can kill the bodie on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but him that can caſt the ſoule into hell. Laſtly, That ſeeing the embaſſadors of <hi>Eugenius</hi> dare preach euerie where their new doctrine, <hi>That the Pope is aboue the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Church,</hi> they ought not deferre the publication of thoſe three Concluſions: yea <hi>That they ſhould imitat the Apoſtle Paul, who would not for one houre forbeare Peter, not walking according to the truth of the Goſpell with a right foot:</hi> But that the other things, which reſpect his perſon, might be deferred, <hi>leaſt Panormitan exclaime more than needs.</hi> At theſe words <hi>Panormitan, Ludouicus Romanus,</hi> and others, made a great tumult, and greatly vpbraided him, That he had related thoſe Concluſions at Louaine, and at Colonia; which he himſelfe alſo denied not. And verie hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could <hi>Iohn de Segouia</hi> obtaine ſilence to be made, though all did take an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great delight to heare him ſpeake: He then ſtrongly confirmed the ſentence of the Preſident, &amp; after many forcible arguments, <hi>The followers of Eugenius</hi> (ſaith <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> he) <hi>preach hereſie all the world ouer, neither doth any ſay vnto them that they ſhould ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe: but to you that intend to publiſh the truth, a thouſand things are whiſpered in your eares, for to make you be ſilent, &amp;c. And to you my Lord Preſident, I ſay, that you muſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pleaſe God than Princes: If you therefore depart hence without concluſion, know that you ſhall render an account thereof in the ſeuere iudgement of God.</hi> And at length the Cardinall of Arles pronounceth ſentence, whereby the minds of the contrarie partie were ſore troubled. The Councell had eſtabliſhed eight <hi>Concluſions,</hi> yet with intention to retaine onely the three former: <hi>Theſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the name of the

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Father and of the Sonne, and of the holie Ghoſt, I conclude.</hi> This ſaid, he roſe vp cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and very many ſtriuing, kiſſe the skirts of his garments, it being the common opinion, That this was rather a worke of the holie Ghoſt, than of him. <hi>Panormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> being much aſhamed, retireth to his lodging, and in his chamber <hi>complaineth
of his king</hi> (the king of Arragon) <hi>in that he had compelled him to fight against the truth, and to loſe his reputation, and his ſoule.</hi> And the Author addeth, That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his proteſtation, he had ſeene him oftentimes in his ſtudie complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his Prince, that he was carried away with the counſell of others: and the Archbiſhop of Arles vpbraideth him, that none was more eagre in publiſhing the errours of <hi>Eugenius,</hi> none more readie to the Monitories and ſuſpenſion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that he ſhould examine his conſcience. Now in the end, the Decree is read and publiſhed, and the Hymne <hi>Te Deum</hi> ſung according to cuſtome, with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the embaſſadors of the Princes, yea of the Emperour and of the king of France, notwithſtanding the endeuours of the aduerſe parties to the contrarie: and they proteſted by the mouth of the Archbiſhop of Tours, That what they had moued to the contrarie, had not beene for that they doubted of the truth and holineſſe of thoſe Concluſions (for which they were euen readie to ſuffer martyrdome) but that they might reſerue to themſelues ſome way of treating a peace. The ſame Authour noteth, That the peſtilence waxing hot at Baſil, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Prelats departed into diuers places, who at the point of death receiuing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Sacrament, ſaid to their friends that ſtood about them, <hi>We are within few houres to appeare before the tribunall ſeat of God: All yee which be preſent pray to God to conuert them who acknowledge Gabriel</hi> (to wit <hi>Eugenius) for Pope, becauſe they cannot be ſaued in that estate;</hi> teſtifying euen to the laſt gaſpe, that they will dye in the faith of the Councell of Baſil. And notwithſtanding all this danger, the Cardinall of Arles would not depart till he had fully brought to paſſe both the depoſition of <hi>Eugeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and the election and coronation of a new Pope, which was <hi>Amade</hi> Duke of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoy, called <hi>Felix</hi> the fourth. Then, becauſe he had beene maried, grew a queſtion whether he might be choſen; it was determined, That <hi>not onely he who hath had a wife, but he which yet hath one, may be admitted: For why elſe (ſay they) doe our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> diſpute, Whether one that hath a wife, being choſen Pope, is bound to yeeld the duetie of mariage to his wife, but becauſe alſo a maried man may be receiued? There haue been alſo (as you know) Popes in mariage ſtate, neither was Peter, the Prince of the Apoſtles, without a wife. Why doe we now obiect theſe things? It may be it were neuer the worſe if many Prieſts did marie,</hi> Sacerdores quam-plures vxorari, <hi>becauſe many would be ſaued in a maried Priesthood, which in a barren are damned.</hi> Some doe note, That the Cardinall of Arles, to whom the prayſe of this whole action is referred, being ſent from the Councell into lower Germanie, in his returne, verie hardly eſcaped an ambuſh which <hi>Eugenius</hi> had layd againſt him; ſo that he ſeemed not without cauſe to haue ſaid in a certaine Seſſion of the Councell, <hi>Chriſt was ſold for thirtie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> peeces of ſiluer, but I was ſold for a farre greater price, for fortie crownes of gold, deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and payed by Gabriel (ſometime Eugenius) that I might be taken priſoner, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented vnto him.</hi>

If not (ſaith he) <hi>Now is the axe layed to the root, the tree leaneth ready to fall, neither can it long perſiſt.</hi> For the feare alſo hee was brought into, leaſt the Councell would take away the temporall of the Church; <hi>A wonderfull mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>if this Councell did not conſiſt of Churchmen, it might perhaps bee doubted: But what Church-man is there, will conſent to this determination, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> becauſe it were againſt faith, but becauſe it would redound to their owne detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp;c. But I feare, leaſt it happen vnto vs as it did to the Iewes, who ſaid, If wee let this man goe, the Romans will come and take away our place and our nation: So likewiſe we, if we ſay, If we admit the Councell to be kept, the Lay-men will come and take away our temporaltie. But as by the iust iudgement of God it came to paſse, that the Iewes loſt their place, which would not let goe Chriſt; ſo by the iust iudgement of God it will come to paſse, That becauſe wee will not let the Councell be called, wee ſhall loſe our temporaltie, and I would to God that not alſo our bodies and ſoules too.</hi> To that which at laſt he replied, That the Councell of Baſil was not lawful; Yea rather, anſwereth he, <hi>it dependeth on the Councell of Conſtance; if that were a true one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> then alſo this. No man hath ſeemed to doubt, whether that were lawfull, nor like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of whatſoeuer was there decreed: for if any ſhould ſay, That the Decrees of that Councell are not of validitie, hee muſt needs alſo confeſſe, that the depoſition of Iohn the foure and twentieth, by vertue of thoſe Decrees, was of no force; If they were of force, neither could the election of Pope Martin hold good, being done whilſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was yet liuing: If Martin was not Pope, then neither is your Holineſse, who were elected of the Cardinals by him created; it importeth therefore none more than your Holineſse, to defend the Decrees of that Councell.</hi> And let the Reader note the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Cardinall againſt the Papiſts, which call into doubt the authoritie of theſe two Councels, and conſequently the vniuerſall vocation and ſucceſſion of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Rome; whereas <hi>Iulian</hi> maintaineth on the contrarie, That there hardly is found any, grounded on ſo manyfold authoritie. And therefore hee defendeth the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, whereby is affirmed, That the Councell is aboue the Pope, by the ſame reaſons and examples, as the Fathers of the Councell of Baſil.</p>
               <p>It was the ordinarie queſtion of that time; in which beſides the deciſion of the Councell of Baſill, the greateſt learned men in particular defend the ſentence of the Councell.

The Pope pilleth not onely the Commonwealth, more than Verres or Catilina, or any other robber of the common trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie durſt do; but alſo makes a gain euen of Eccleſiaſtical goods, and the holie Ghoſt, which Simon Magus himſelfe deteſteth. And when he is of ſome men admoniſhed and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of theſe things, he denieth them not, but confeſſeth them openly, and boaſteth of it as lawfull; and by any meanes will haue the patrimonie of the Church giuen by Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, wrested out of the hands of them that occupie it: as if that being recouered, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an religion would be more happie, and not rather more oppreſſed with wickedneſſe, luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and luſts, if yet it can be any more oppreſſed, and that there is any place further left <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> for wickedneſſe, &amp;c.

There is therefore no more religion, no holineſſe, no feare of God, and, which I ſpeake with horrour, impious men take the excuſe of all their wicked crimes from the Pope. For in him, and in them which accompanie him, is the example of all wickedneſſe; ſo that we may ſay with Eſay and S.

He ſeiſed vpon all for himſelfe, and retained the <hi>Scarampi,</hi> till the things which had beene tranſported to Florence were brought backe to Rome. Out of theſe particular actions may be judged, what was the conſcience of this man, on whoſe will they will haue the commonwealth depend. <hi>Iames Picinin,</hi> a famous captaine, retained king <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> yea and <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe, in their duetie. <hi>Francis Sforza,</hi> Duke of Milan, his father in law, ſendeth him to the king, vnder faith giuen, That whenſoeuer he would he ſhould returne againe ſafe. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> caſts him into priſon, with his ſonne, and a while after put him to death, ſaying, <hi>That he falling downe in the priſon it ſelfe, brake his leg, whileſt he beheld at a window, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> more attentiuely than heedfully, the kings gallies returning with victorie from Iſchia.</hi> It was thought of ſome that <hi>Paul</hi> had a hand in that treacherie, <hi>ſeeing that in thoſe dayes the Biſhop of Milan went verie often to and fro betweene the Pope and the king, and Paul himſelfe ſaid, when he heard of his captiuitie, That the Iudge of Appeales was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the way.</hi> A while after he entred into a conceit, That one <hi>Callimachus,</hi> a Roman, had conſpired againſt him; whereupon, as his fantaſie led him, he taketh hold of all that ſtand in reach, &amp; committeth them to priſon, and that ſo much the more eagrely, for that it was told him that <hi>Lucas Tortius,</hi> a gentleman of Rome, baniſhed to Naples, was ſeene thereabouts with ſome troupes: And <hi>Platina</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe came into his mind, taking a felicitie in his ſuſpitions, whom being apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> he commanded ſhould preſently be put to the rack. Although a few dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he vnderſtood that this <hi>Lucas</hi> had not ſtirred one foot, and certainly knew that this pretended conſpiracie was altogether vaine and without ground, <hi>Yet he would needs make ſhew, that there was ſome hidden cauſe, leaſt he ſhould be accuſed of lightneſſe.</hi> Wherefore many in the midſt of their torments died, men of good note, whoſe names and dignities the Author ſetteth downe: twentie within the ſpace of two dayes were called in queſtion, and ſifted to the vtmoſt; <hi>Platina</hi> among others, <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I did hang in theſe torments naked, rent as a theefe and murderer, Vianen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius handling the bracelets of Sanga de Cioggia, his companion, asked him what wench had

In the meane time he himſelfe came to viſit them in the caſtle, and when all other accuſations failed him, he chargeth them with hereſie, That they had diſputed of the immortalitie of the ſoule out of the opinion of <hi>Plato,</hi> which Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> affirmed to come neereſt to the opinion of a Chriſtian; and for that they prayſed the auncient Accademie, and condemned the new, <hi>he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> them heretikes, which either in earneſt or in ieaſt ſhould from thenceforth any more make mention of the name of an Accademie.</hi> So that if <hi>Laelius de Valla,</hi> a Roman ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen, and an Aduocat in the Conſiſtorie, had not taken their cauſe in hand, they had vndergone the puniſhment of hereſie. At length wearied with the entreaties of the Cardinals, he ſetteth them at libertie, but yet in ſuch a ſort, as that hee euer watched ouer their ſteps, ſo that they judged not themſelues to be free til after his death; Death which tooke him by an Apoplexie, when he had ordained that the Iubilie ſhould be celebrated euerie twentie fiue yeares, which falling in the yeare 1475, filled his mind with hope of exceſſiue gaine.

                  <p>Now in the time of <hi>Nicholas</hi> and <hi>Calixtus,</hi> after the <hi>neutralitie</hi> of Germanie was taken away by the meanes of <hi>Aeneas Syluius,</hi> for which good ſeruice hee had beene firſt made Biſhop, and after Cardinall, the Germans were offended that the conditions agreed vpon with the Emperour were not obſerued: Wherefore by the authoritie and conduct of <hi>Diether</hi> Archbiſhop of Mentz, they had inſtituted a certaine <hi>Pragmaticall ſanction,</hi> whereby they would prouide for themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the grieuances of the Roman Church; and partly decreed of the election of Prelats, collation of benefices, hearing of cauſes, granting of Indulgences, exaction of tenthes, and the like; partly they defended themſelues alſo by way of Appeale, againſt the Pope, if he ordained any thing againſt them; and moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> fortified this with a ſtrict league of the Princes. Hence it is that <hi>Syluius</hi> is ſo vehemently moued in his Epiſtle <hi>of the maners of Germanie,</hi> which he wrot in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to <hi>Martin Mayer,</hi> Chauncellour of the Archbiſhop of Mentz; for note, hee was newly made Cardinall of Sienna. This <hi>Mayer</hi> was a man famous in that age, euen by the teſtimonie of <hi>Syluius</hi> himſelfe, and had complained in his Lords be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, That the Decrees of Conſtance and of Baſil were not obſerued: That <hi>Calix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> as if he were not tied to the couenants of his predeceſſor, exhauſted and ſoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Germanie, euer and anon reiected the election of Prelats, and reſerued the benefices and dignities of whatſoeuer kind, for his Cardinals and Protonotaries: For (ſaid he) <hi>expectatiue graces are granted without number, Annates or firſt fruits <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> are exacted without any delay of time, openly alſo extorting more than is due. The go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of Churches are not committed to them that deſerue beſt, but to ſuch as offer moſt, and new Indulgences are daily granted for to rake in money. Exactions of tenthes, vnder colour of the Turkes, are commaunded to be made, without taking aduiſe of our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats. Cauſes which had beene handled and determined in the countrey, are confuſedly drawne to the Apoſtolicall Seat, and a thouſand new meanes are inuented, whereby with a ſubtill wit to draw money from vs, as from Barbarians. And you, vnder this forme, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto vnuſuall and vnheard of, haue obtained reſeruation to three Prouinces of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie.</hi> And in concluſion, That the Princes being awaked out of their ſleepe, were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> reſolued to ſhake off that yoke, and to take againe their former libertie, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great dammage to the Court of Rome. Wherefore, though hee congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him his new dignitie, yet he tooke it ill that theſe euils happened in his time, and ſeriouſly exhorted him to procure a remedie betimes. <hi>But it may be</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the mind of God is otherwiſe, and his ſentence will preuaile:</hi> Giuing vs in theſe few words, more to thinke of than he expreſſeth. What then doth here the new Cardinall? You may ſee he hath ſtraight changed his ſtile, ſo that to a friend wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting friendly, at the verie beginning in an angrie manner, he ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt mixed</hi> amara &amp; rancida, <hi>vnſauorie and bitter things in thy letters:</hi> So much was his taſt then alreadie altered; for afterwards there was nothing ſo vniuſt which he defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not, nothing ſo abſurd which he vttered not, neither feared hee to eſtabliſh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the Popes tyrannie, by thoſe verie places which before he had proued to be wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted into a wrong ſence. To conclude, nothing was with him more execrable than the Pragmaticall ſanction, which before he had pronounced to be ſacred and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall. He vpbraided the Germans, That they were too rich, and ingratefull to the Church of Rome, which of Heathens had made them Chriſtians, of Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians Latines: Whereas indeed the Germans had Chriſtian Churches, which S. <hi>Ireneus</hi> commendeth for their notable conſtancie, before the name of Pope of Rome was once knowne, when they which ruled the Church were onely called

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Prieſts.

And becauſe hee dwelt at Norimberg, being Syndicke or Aduocat of the citie, he writeth an Epiſtle to the Burg-maſter and Senat, in which he calleth this forme of appealing from the Pope to a Councell, <hi>A new hereſie and inſpiration of the Diuell, ſeeing that men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale friuolouſly and by way of mockerie to a Councell, or to that which is no where;</hi> and which they purpoſe to auoyd and hinder by all meanes poſſible.

But, from this excommunication alſo <hi>Heimburg</hi> againe appealed to a Councell, yet is conſtrained to depart into Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, where he married a wife and made his abode; vntill <hi>Diether</hi> Archbiſhop of Mentz of the familie of <hi>Heimburg,</hi> being vexed by the Pope, called him vnto him; whereby we may gather that <hi>Diether</hi> did not greatly diſlike his doctrine. In the appeale of <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> that he framed, after hee had layed open the equitie of his cauſe, againſt the vnjuſt proceedings of the Pope, he appealed not <hi>from the Pope ill informed, to the Pope better informed,</hi> becauſe he knew his eares to bee ſtopped, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> but eyther to his ſucceſſour, or to a generall Councell to be celebrated, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Decrees of Conſtance and Baſill, and in default thereof, to Ieſus Chriſt Sauiour of the world. In his owne alſo, when <hi>Pius</hi> the ſecond had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated him, he proteſted the verie ſame; but moreouer, examining his Bull and his letters which he had written to them of Norimberg, <hi>Our Sauiour</hi> (ſaid <hi>Pius) ſubſtituted Peter Prince of the Apoſtles to the gouernement of the Church.

This their admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> may be ſeene at large, recited by <hi>Iohn</hi> Cardinall of Arles, comprehended in 89 Articles in the workes of <hi>Peter Pithou,</hi> which is worthie the Readers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſing. There, among other things, they declared vnto him, out of the holie Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the practiſe of the Primitiue Church, Canons of Councels, Decrees of the Fathers, ordinances of Popes themſelues, and by the lawes of Chriſtian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and Kings, eſpecially of ours, That the Election of Biſhops, Abbots, and other Prelats of the Church, doth no whit depend, and neuer haue depended of the Biſhop of Rome.

The Abbay as we haue ſayd, was of great fame in Fraunce, hauing no ill in it for which it had need to be commended. It was apparant, that hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it not for deſire of good worke, but for couetouſneſſe. In comming therfore to ſpeake their opinions, the Cardinall de Porto, who was next to the Cardinall of Hoſtia, I feare, Holie Father (ſaith he) that verie ſhortly we ſhall heare that al the Abbayes in France will be in Commenda, ſo that there will not any remain that hath an Abbot; for whatſoeuer we ordayne there, is nothing elſe but Commenda's.

King Charles the ſeuenth the king, who then was Dolphin, being preſent, together with the Princes of the bloud Royall, the Prelats, and the Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges Eccleſiaſticall and Scholaſticall, and in the hearing of the Embaſſadours both of the Pope of Rome, and of the holie vniuerſall Councell; at length he receiued thoſe Decrees, and confirmed them by his Edict, which commonly wee call Pragmaticall. And theſe things were done a Bourges in the yeare</hi> 1438. <hi>This ſanction therefore was euer held to be of ſo much the more authoritie, becauſe it had the originall from the holie Councels, in which the Pope, or his Legat ſat Preſident. For there had beene neuer any law made <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> in Fraunce before that time, which had authoritie and force from the vniuerſall Church.</hi> 16. <hi>From that time forth the kingdome better proſpered, and had greater authoritie and glorie than ever before, and more plentie and abundance of all things. Guienne and Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie can witneſſe, what terrour it was to the enemies, out of which places they were expulſed and caſt out.</hi> 17. <hi>The obſeruation of this ſanction dured the ſpace of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and three yeares, and now ſince hath ceaſed theſe foure yeares: When in the meane time men of excellent probitie and grauitie haue gouerned and ruled the Churches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out moleſtation and diſturbance; of which ſome for the ſingular ſanctitie of their liues, after their deceaſe were had in reputation for miracles, as Michaell Biſhop of Angers, the Archbiſhop of Arles, and many others.</hi> 18. <hi>Contrariwiſe, of the abrogation of theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Decrees and Constitutions, innumerable inconueniences would ariſe, which ſeeme may be referred to foure kinds:</hi> Thoſe ſame which were obſerued in the admonition afore mentioned. But the king being troubled either with continuall warres, or with ſuſpitions, from time to time put off the buſineſſe to a generall aſſemblie. Yet (ſaith <hi>Monſtrelet</hi>) in the yeare 1467, <hi>Paule</hi> the ſecond being Pope,<note place="margin">Monſtrelet es Chronologiques.</note> the king graunted his letters to his Legat being come from Rome, in the moneth of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, for the abrogation of the Pragmaticall ſanction, which were exhibited and publiſhed in the Chaſtellet of Paris, without any contradiction or diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance. But he addeth, on the firſt day of October following, <hi>M. Iohn Balue</hi> (who
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:15502:319"/>

And to Balue he ſaid, That he might bluſh for ſhame, for hauing vndertaken the diſpatch of ſuch a buſineſſe. And after that the Rector of the Vniuerſitie of Paris, and the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſame, came to the Legat himſelfe, and appealed from him and from the effect of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his ſaid letters, to the Councell, and in whatſoeuer place it ſhould be made.

The yeare following, one M. <hi>Iohn Loyre,</hi> by vertue of certaine Bulls from the Pope, interdicted the citie and Dioceſſe of Niuers, vſing the authoritie of the Officiall of Beſanſon: But by the ſentence of the Court it was decreed the twelfth of December, at the ſuit of the kings Attur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney generall, and of M. <hi>Peter Chartres,</hi> Doctor and Profeſſor of Diuinitie in the Vniuerſitie of Paris, That notwithſtanding the Interdict the Diuine Seruice <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſhould be continued, and the Churchmen compelled vnto it, being by the kings power ſet into their temporalties: That alſo the ſaid <hi>Loire</hi> and Officiall ſhould be layd hold on, and be held to procure at their owne charges the abrogation of the Bulls.</p>

The state of the Church was neuer in ſo great daunger from the beginning of the world, as it is to be ſeene at this preſent. There haue been indeed grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perſecutions and vexations of the Church, but there were euer holie and deuout men, who endued with the grace of the holie ſpirit, comforted the faithfull, inſtructing and ſtrengthening them.

Therefore the Church decreaſeth in faithfull men and in kingdomes, it pineth away in perſons, notwithſtanding the libertie it hath.

But this fell out well for them, that after diuers miſeries, was choſen

And as he conſtantly perſeuered therein, notwithſtanding the threats of the Emperour and Pope, hee was excommunicated by <hi>Paul</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and his Eſtate expoſed to the firſt inuaders thereof. <hi>Matthias</hi> king of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie tooke vpon him the conqueſt of this Prouince, by the inſtigation of <hi>Rodolfe</hi> the Popes Legat, with the approbation of the Emperour <hi>Fredericke</hi> the third, and by the fauour of many of the great men of the kingdome. But after many battels fought with variable ſucceſſe, he could not bring his purpoſe to paſſe.

Of theſe the principall was Aſcanius Sfortia who ſold himſelfe at a high price, that hee that of the whole order was the moſt wicked, might in ſtead of the beſt be choſen Pope.</hi> And there they relate how he ouerthrew them all, ſome by exile, ſome by impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, ſome by violent death, ſome he ſtrangled, ſome he poyſoned. But <hi>Guic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciardin</hi> more exquiſitely, <hi>He was choſen Pope</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by meanes of the diſcord that was betwixt the Cardinals Aſcanius Sfortia, and Iulian of S.

To this abhominable negotiation, many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them were drawne by Cardinall Aſcanius, not onely by perſuaſion but example, who being corrupted by an infinit deſire of riches, bargained with the Pope, that for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of this his great wickedneſſe, he might haue the Vice-Chauncellorſhip, which was the principall office of the Court of Rome, enriched with moſt pretious furniture. But the Pope could not auoyd, neither for the time to come the iudgement of God, nor for the time <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> preſent the infamie, and iuſt hatred of men, filled by reaſon of this election with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and horrour, becauſe it was made by diſhoneſt meanes, and the nature and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the man knowne vnto all: And among others to the king of Naples, who though in publique he diſſembled his griefe, yet he opened it to the Queene his wife, and that with teares, from which he was woont to refraine, euen at the death of his children, becauſe they had choſen a Pope, who would proue dangerous not onely to Italie, but all Chriſtendome: A diuination not vnworthie the wiſedome of Ferdinand, for there was in Alexander a quick and ſubtile wit, a deepe reach of iudgement, a maruelous force to perſuade, and in all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires

His maners were verie diſhoneſt; there was in him no ſinceritie, no ſhame, no truth, no faith, no religion; but rather vnſatiable auarice, ambition beyond meaſure, more than brutiſh crueltie, and an inſatiable deſire to raiſe his ſonnes, which were many in number, whether by right or by wrong, to the higheſt dignities, among which one of them in all manner of wickedneſſe was equall with the father.</hi> And here let the Reader againe compare theſe manners with thoſe gifts that are neceſſarie for a Biſhop, remembred by <hi>Paul</hi> 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 3. The onely end therefore of all his endeuours, was to encreaſe the honour and greatneſſe of his ſonnes, whom hee was not aſhamed to acknowledge to be his to the whole world: for he would not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> haue them accounted for nephewes, as others were woont to doe, the better to couer their ſhame. In the firſt Conſiſtorie he created <hi>Iohn Borgia,</hi> his ſiſters ſonne, Cardinall: but he was vpon the ſudden ſtricken with a ſtrange feare. <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth, king of Fraunce, attempting the poſſeſſion of the kingdome of Naples, came with a great power into Italie, being inuited by <hi>Lodouicus Maurus,</hi> Duke of Milan, and other Princes of Italie: againſt whom <hi>Alexander</hi> made a league with <hi>Alphonſus</hi> of Aragon, heire to his father <hi>Ferdinand</hi> in the kingdome of Naples: The principall conditions were theſe, That <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould inueſt <hi>Alphonſus</hi> into the kingdome of Naples, at the ſame rate that he did his father, and ſhould ſend his Apoſtolicall Legat to put the Crowne vpon his head: That hee ſhould <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> create <hi>Lodowicke</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Henrie,</hi> who was <hi>Alphonſus</hi> his baſtard brother, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall: Againe, That <hi>Alphonſus</hi> on the other ſide ſhould pay to the Pope thirtie thouſand ducats: That he ſhould giue to the Duke of Candia, the eldeſt ſonne of <hi>Alexander,</hi> in the kingdome twelue thouſand ducats of yearely reuenew, and the firſt of the ſeuen principall offices that ſhould be voyd: That he ſhould main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine at his charge three hundred men at armes, to be alwayes readie when need ſhold be to ſerue him: That vpon <hi>Caeſar Borgia,</hi> his other ſon, by him made Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, he ſhold beſtow benefices to a certain yerely value. Here the Author noteth, That he made him Cardinall <hi>after that he had proued by falſe witneſſes, that hee was the lawfull ſonne of another, becauſe otherwiſe hee could not haue beene capable of that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> dignitie.</hi> What impudencie was this, hauing before commonly called them, and publikely ſhewed them to be his ſonnes?</p>
               <p>In the meane time <hi>Charles</hi> prepared a great armie for this voyage, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that <hi>Alexander</hi> did ſometimes dehort him from it with his Briefes, ſometimes threaten him with his Eccleſiaſticall cenſures.<note place="margin">Paulus Iouius l. <hi>2.</hi>

the more eaſily beleeued, becauſe hee was not ignorant how many troubles the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> French had raiſed, and how many ſlaughters they had made in Aſia. The warres of <hi>Charles</hi> growing hot, they ſent Legats againe vnto him, <hi>Alphonſus</hi> making choyce of <hi>Camillus Pendon, Alexander</hi> of <hi>Gregorio Bucciardo</hi> of Genoa, being both skilfull in the Turkiſh language; <hi>Bucciardo</hi> being employed before in the like ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice by Pope <hi>Innocent.</hi> Theſe promiſed to ouerthrow the forces of <hi>Charles,</hi> ſo he would ſupplie them with ſome great ſummes of money: Whereby he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme the State of Greece from deſtruction, and entertaine warre in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of another, <hi>and ſhould haue for a bulwarke of his Empire the citie of Rome and the kingdome of Naples.</hi> Theſe embaſſadours were honourably receiued by <hi>Baia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet,</hi> and ſo much the rather, becauſe hee had receiued the ſame newes from other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> parts: <hi>He therefore gaue thankes to the Pope (ſpeaking to Gregorie) that he that had the higheſt place in Chriſtendome would be pleaſed ſo friendly &amp; louingly to giue him in time admonition, notwithſtanding he were of another beliefe touching God, and of different maners touching men.</hi> He aduiſed him to returne into Italie, his embaſſadour <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> accompanying him, by whom he ſent money, and committed other matters of ſecrecie vnto him to that purpoſe. <hi>Amongst other matters giuen vnto him in charge</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iouius) there was a letter written in Greeke, wherein Baiazet with great art perſuaded the Pope, That he ſhould prouide that by ſome meanes or other his brother might be taken out of the way by poyſon; which if he would performe, hee promiſed him vpon his faith two hundred thouſand ducats, and freely to beſtow vpon him the vnfea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> coat of Chriſt, as ſome few yeares before he had ſent the poynt of that ſpeare where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Longinus pierced the ſide of Chriſt.</hi> From hence let the Reader judge with how inward a commerce of wickedneſſe theſe two were joined, ſince he durſt giue that counſell to the Pope, which the moſt wicked men of the world, practiſed in all manner of villanie, durſt not haue done one to another. It fell out in the meane time, that the ſhips wherein they paſſed the ſeas, were taken neere Ancona by <hi>Iohn de la Rouere,</hi> brother to Cardinall <hi>Iulian,</hi> an enemie to the Pope, and a friend to the Frenchmen, who ſeiſed vpon all the money as due vnto him from the Pope, and ſo <hi>Dantius</hi> was inforced to make a journey by land to Ancona, to ſaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> But <hi>Alexander</hi> being verie much moued herewith, ſought new meanes to continue this entercourſe and agreement with <hi>Baiazet.</hi> With which Papall zeale he likewiſe diuerted the Croyſado, or money gathered in Spaine, vnder a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of bearing the croſſe againſt <hi>Baiazet,</hi> to this vſe: <hi>For</hi> (ſaith <hi>Guicciardine) king Ferdinand excuſing himſelfe, That his armie by ſea could not ſo ſpeedily be readie, for the defence of the kingdome of Naples, for want of money, hee conſented that the money gathered in Spaine, in the na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Now ſo long as <hi>Alexander</hi> was in doubt of the authour of the death of his ſonne, he was ſtrangely moued therewith, and made a ſhew of changing the courſe of his life; but ſo ſoone as he was aſſured of the truth thereof, he returned to his old vomit, and thought it neceſſarie to diſſemble the matter. <hi>Onuphrius</hi> ſpeakes more ſignificantly, <hi>Winking at that outragious ſinne of paricide,</hi> hee determined <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> with himſelfe at what price or perill ſoeuer to aduance <hi>Borgia</hi> the paricide. It would be perhaps too long, and to ſmall purpoſe, here to relate the deeds of this monſter. Comming one morning into the Conſiſtorie, he put off his Cardinals hat, and openly profeſſed that he would be a man of warre.

Caeſar Borgia, his ſonne, Duke of Valentia, had reſolued with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to poyſon Adrian Cardinall of Coruoto, in whoſe vineyard they were to ſup that night. He ſent therefore before certaine flagons of poyſoned wine, which he cauſed to be deliuered to a ſeruant of his, with a ſtrict commaund that no man ſhould taſt, or touch it. It happened, that before the houre of ſupper Alexander came, who being verie hot and thirſtie, called for wine, and becauſe his ſupper was not yet brought from the Palace, the partie to whom the wine was giuen in cuſtodie, thinking that charge that was giuen him for the ſafe keeping thereof, was becauſe it was a more excellent wine than the reſt, filled <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſome of that wine that the Duke had ſent to another purpoſe, and gaue it to the Pope. It happened that whileſt his father was drinking the Duke came in, and dranke of the ſame wine to: but the ſonne</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>partly becauſe hee was young, and partly becauſe hee vſed preſent remedies, eſcaped, though oppreſſed with a long and a grieuous ſickneſse.</hi> Hee addeth, <hi>For it is moſt certaine, that both the father and the ſonne were woont to vſe poyſon, not onely to bee reuenged of their enemies, or to ſecure themſelues againſt daungers ſuſpected, but alſo to ſatisfie their vnſatiable deſire of riches, and to ſpoyle the richer ſort of their goods, Cardinalls and Courtiers that had neuer offended them. Thus they tooke out of the way the Cardinall of S. Angelo, who was verie rich, and thus diuers others of their neereſt and moſt faithfull friends and followers, as the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of Capua and Modena. To conclude, there was</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a wonderfull concourſe of people out of all parts of the citie, who with vnſpeakable ioy came to Saint Peters Palace to glut their eyes, if they could, with the ſight of the dead carkaſſe of this ſerpent, who with his vnbridled ambition, perfidious treacherie, horrible crueltie, monſtrous luxurie, inſatiable auarice, ſelling without difference or reſpect, things holie and prophane, had infected the whole world.</hi> In the ſelfeſame manner ſpeakes <hi>Onuphrius</hi> the Popes Hiſtoriographer: <hi>His treacherie was more than Punicall, his crueltie barbarous, his couetouſneſſe and extortion vnmeaſurable, his deſire to enrich his children, whether by right or by wrong, vnſatiable. Hee was ſtrangely giuen to women, by whom hee had foure ſonnes and two daughters.

But on the other ſide the Cardinall of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bois, preſuming vpon the fauour of the French Cardinals, and the power of the armie, withſtood him; <hi>The Cardinals neuertheleſſe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Guicciardine) according to their cuſtome, looking euer into their owne benefit:</hi> for it is that ſpirit that properly beares rule in thoſe Conclaues. Theſe therefore (partly by reaſon of their owne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarice, &amp; partly the one ſide hindring the other by reaſon of this emulation) make choice of neither, but chuſe <hi>Francis Picolhuomini,</hi> called <hi>Pius</hi> the third, a man verie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> old, and then ſick; rather to ſpend ſome time, than that they had any hope of his Popedome, for within 26 dayes after he died: after whoſe death, beſides and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all order, they determined of a ſucceſſor without the Conclaue, becauſe the Cardinall of S. <hi>Peter ad Vincula,</hi> being mightie in friends and fame, and power, had gotten ſo many voyces on his part, that there was not any man that durſt ſo much as mutter againſt him: Wherefore by a new example he entred the Conclaue, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured before of the Popedom, and the doors being neuer ſhut, was choſen the firſt night: who, to ſignifie the greatneſſe of his deſignes, euen in the firſt entrance of his Popedome would be called <hi>Iulius</hi> the ſecond: <hi>Whereupon euery man</hi> (ſaith <hi>Guic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciardine) was ſtrucken with a kind of aſtoniſhment, for that they had conſented vpon the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> choice of ſuch a Pope, as all men knew to be dangerous, intollerable, truculent, and vnquiet, yea that he had alreadie practiſed ſtrange hatreds againſt many great perſonages.</hi> But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing noted in him thoſe parts that were beſt worthie the conſideration, <hi>That</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which ſtood him in best ſtead for the attainment of this dignitie, were the large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that he made to thoſe Cardinals, Princes, Barons, and others, whom hee knew to be best able to aduance and forward that buſineſſe, thinking it good policie not to denie them any thing they ſhould aske. Moreouer, he gaue much money, and many benefices and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiastical dignities, as wel of his own as other mens; for that opinion there was of his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that diuers there were that came vnto him, offering vnto him what they poſſeſſed, to vſe their money, their names, their offices, their benefices, at his pleaſure: no man conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> with himſelfe that he had promiſed a great deale more than, hauing obtained the Popedome, he was either able, or ought to performe, being heretofore accounted ſo vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and ſo true, that Alexander the ſixt, though he were his great enemie, otherwiſe ſpeaking all the ill that might be of him, acknowledged that onely vertue in him. But hee that verie well knew, that no man might more eaſily deceiue, than hee that was thought neuer to deceiue, feared not a little to cracke that credit to get a Popedome.</hi> And thus much concerning the manner of his election. Hee had a daughter which was named <hi>Felix,</hi> whom hee preſently maried to <hi>Iordanus Vrſinus,</hi> and his neece, his ſiſters daughter, to <hi>Antonius Columna.</hi> And thus hee ſetled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> at Rome. From thence forward hee bent his endeuours, by armes to bring Romania vnder his ſubiection, and to recouer all that which <hi>Borgia</hi> and others had gotten into their poſſeſſion: and if any refuſed to obey, hee was preſently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated. Then he ſhooke off that moderation which in his Cardinalſhip he retained <hi>both in word &amp; deed</hi> (ſaith <hi>Onuphrius) in ſo much that he thought it not ynough to be modeſt himſelfe, but he tooke a care to receiue none but ſuch into his houſe.</hi>

                  </note> So hard a matter it is, and euer hath been, to know the humor of him that affecteth a Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.

                  <hi>Lewis</hi> held a nationall Councel at Tours, wherein it was enquired, <hi>Whether it were lawful for the Pope, without a cauſe, to make warre againſt a Prince:</hi> It was concluded not lawfull: <hi>And whether any ſuch Prince defending may not aſſault him, &amp; withdraw himſelfe from his obedience:</hi> It was concluded lawfull. Moreouer, it was reſolued to maintaine in France the Pragmaticall ſanction, and in all cauſes to neglect his cenſures: and that the king before he ſhould withdraw himſelfe from his obedience, ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie <hi>Iulius</hi> by his embaſſadors of theſe articles ordained by his Clergie, that if hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſhould not obey them, he might vnderſtand, that he was to be called to a generall Councell. And moreouer it was decreed, That the king ſhould impoſe vpon the Clergie of France, a certaine ſumme of money, to be imployed againſt <hi>Iulius,</hi> if he ſhould proceed in his determination. It happened in the meane time, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Gurſe arriued in the behalfe of the Emperour, who was heard in that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable aſſemblie, at what time there came likewiſe a meſſenger, who gaue them to vnderſtand of the obſtinacie of <hi>Iulius;</hi> wereupon, the 27 of September, a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councel was called, by the conſent of all, at Lions, to be celebrated about the beginning of March following. All this was done by the aduice of fiue of the chiefe Cardinals, of S. Croſſe &amp; Coſentia, Spaniards, Bayeux &amp; S. Malo, French, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and the Cardinall of S.

                  </note> notwithſtanding (if we may beleeue <hi>Guicciardine</hi>) they had as bad minds, and were as little to be truſted as himſelfe. So vniuerſall was the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that See, how good ſoeuer the deſires of the king were.</p>
               <p>In the meane time <hi>Iulius</hi> is not idle, though hee thought of nothing leſſe than what became a Pope: he agreed, by meanes of the Cardinall <hi>de Medicis,</hi> with <hi>Marcus Antonius Columna,</hi> and other young men of Florence, to kill <hi>Peter Sode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi> the Standard-bearer of the Commonwealth of Florence, becauſe he was ſaid

to be the man that perſuadeth the Florentines to take part with Fraunce, <hi>which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> turned to his great infamie.</hi> Being reſolued to attempt Ferrara, he thought it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter firſt to inuade Mirandula: which foraſmuch as it fell out to be a long ſiege, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much troubled that things ſucceded not according to his expectation, he came to the ſiege in his owne perſon, <hi>a thing neuer heard of before, nor euer to be expected, that the Vicar of Chriſt on earth</hi> (ſaith <hi>Guicciardine) ſhould inuade a Chriſtian citie, and being old and ſickly, ſhould in his owne perſon, ſet forward a warre againſt Chriſtian Princes firſt raiſed by himſelfe;</hi> wherein he was ſo earneſtly bent, and ouer haſtie, that he neuer thought any thing done with ſpeed ynough, but euer kindled with furie, cried out to the captaines; and choſe his owne lodging amongſt the ordnance, inſomuch that in his kitchin two of his ſeruants were ſlaine with a ſhot,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> whatſoeuer his Cardinals could perſuade to the contrarie, telling him, That hereby both his owne perſon and the whole See were made a ſcandall, and a laughing ſtocke to the whole world. And therefore, ſaith <hi>Monstrelet</hi> to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>He left the chaire of S.

How good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie a thing it was to ſee the Myters, Croſſes, and Croſier-ſtaues flying vp and downe the field, God he knoweth. It is not likely any Diuels could be there, where bleſſings were ſold at ſo baſe a price.</hi> Mirandula being taken, he ſet forward with his armie againſt Ferrara, and neglecting theſe conditions that the Emperor offered, and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of Spain his friend, he perſiſted in his determination. Wherupon,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> it was thought good to cite him to the Councel of Piſa; on the one ſide, thoſe fiue Cardinals, with the Prelats of Fraunce and Germanie vrging it, as beeing a man notoriouſly ſcandalous, incorrigible, a ſtirrer vp of warres, and altogether vnfit to rule the Popedome, for which cauſe, the authoritie of calling a Councell was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolued vnto them; on the other ſide, king <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth being readie by force, and if need were, to march againſt him with his armie in his owne perſon, notwithſtanding he had no aſſiſtance from <hi>Maximilian:</hi> who hauing made a truce with the Pope, was therefore by the writers of that age condemned of inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. It is worthie the noting, that by the commaund of <hi>Lewis</hi> there was money coyned in Fraunce, which yet remaineth in the cuſtodie of ſome, in the one ſide <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> wherof there was this mot, <hi>I will deſtroy Babylon,</hi> and in ſome, <hi>I will deſtroy the name of Babylon;</hi> that it might ſeeme no new thing to any that Rome is Babylon to vs, hauing ſo great an Authour, euen the Father of Fraunce. <hi>Iulius</hi> therefore created eight new Cardinals, that he might thereby win vnto him other Princes, contrary to that he had promiſed at his election. <hi>Triuultius</hi> therefore, the leader of the French forces, hauing freed Ferrara from feare, taken Bononia, publiquely faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his placarts whereby <hi>Iulius</hi> was cited to Piſa, he retired himſelfe in deſpaire to Rome; no leſſe wounded in his mind, that the Duke of Vrbin his Nephew had ſtabbed the Cardinall of Pauia his Legat and inward friend, in a manner before his eyes, <hi>for his many and monstrous wickedneſſe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Guicciardine) worthie the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and moſt grieuous puniſhment.</hi> Then gathering heart, he confirmed his truces, mollified the mind of the Emperour, woon him from the alliance of Fraunce, and thinking now he had ouercome all difficulties, he applied his thoughts onely to <hi>Lewis,</hi> thundring againſt him with his excommunications, and interdicting his kingdome. But our Clergie yeelding him neuer the more obedience, proceed ſtill in ſetting forward the Councell of Piſa, which at the laſt was thought to be more ſafe and commodious to transferre to Milan, where againe theſe good Cardinals got no better reputation than <hi>Iulius</hi> at Rome. At length, <hi>Iulius</hi> with his confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:15502:334"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> raiſed an armie, which doubtleſſe would daily encreaſe greater, by reaſon of the jealouſie that many Princes had of the greatneſſe of Fraunce, and aboue all the Spaniard, for fear of the realm of Naples, which the French pretended a right vnto. But king <hi>Lewis</hi> ſeeing himſelfe alone againſt ſo many enemies, either open, or readie ſhortly to declare themſelues, reſolued to win time; and commaunded <hi>Gaſton de Foix,</hi> his Lieutenant generall in the Duchie of Milan, to omit no occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of fighting with the Popes armie, wherein, if he got the victorie, he ſhould with all ſpeed march to Rome, and there aſſaile the Pope without any reuerence towards him. Yet notwithſtanding, that it might be eſtemed he did it lawfully and by good right, he doth all by the authoritie of the Councell, which appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> their Legat in the armie, who receiued in the name thereof the cities conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the warre. This was the Cardinall of S. Seuerin, ordayned by the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, Legat of Bononia, <hi>A man</hi> (ſaith our Authour) <hi>more adicted to warre,</hi>

                  <hi>than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> Therefore <hi>Gaſton,</hi> after ſome notable exploits of armes, for to draw the Popes armie to battaile, beſieged Rauenna. In the meane time <hi>Iulius</hi> armie came to ſuccour it, vnder the conduct of <hi>Iohn de Medicis</hi> (after <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth) exiled from Florence, whom he had aduanced chiefely in hatred of the Florentines. But <hi>Gaſton</hi> marched againſt them, and vpon an Eaſter day gaue them battell, wherein he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned that ſo renowned victorie of Rauenna. The Legat taken, and the moſt part of the commaunders of the armie; vpon the firſt newes thereof, <hi>Iulius</hi> deſpairing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> was readie to forſake Rome: but the death of <hi>Gaſton</hi> interrupted the courſe of the victorie, and ſo gaue him time to breath and ſettle himſelfe in his ſeat. And that ſo much the more, for that the Mareſchal <hi>de la Palice,</hi> with the French forces, which he commaunded after the death of <hi>Gaston,</hi> was called backe into Fraunce, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelues againſt the Switzers, who partly in fauour of <hi>Iulius,</hi> partly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by their owne commoditie, had ſpred themſelues ouer Bourgundie.</p>
               <p>Now, he turned this victorie obtayned by the French men, to his owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, by ſetting before the eyes of all Princes, of how great moment it was, that the power of the French men ſhould be repreſſed. This he doth with the States of Italie, chiefely the Duke of Ferrara and the Florentines, to withdraw <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> them from their league with France; he blameth the kings indiſcretion, who not knowing how to vſe his good fortune, had withdrawne his ſuccours, and abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his confederats to his diſcretion. And now he onely ſpake of ſhaking off the Arragonois, and of driuing the Spaniſh forces out of Italie, or defeating them, by whoſe helpe notwithſtanding he had beene maintayned in his aduerſitie; for to procure to himſelfe the kingdome of Naples. Laſtly, he thought himſelfe in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſafetie by the friendſhip and confederacie of the Switzers. Moreouer, he now openly deſpiſed the Councell of Piſa, which had beene tranſlated to Milan, becauſe it was onely maintayned by the French forces, who had now ynough to doe to defend their owne; and taking againe courage, oppoſed vnto it another <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Councell at Lateran, excommunicating all them that adhered to that of Piſa; and king <hi>Lewis</hi> by name, from whom, by his Bull ſet forth, be tooke away the title of Moſt-Chriſtian, transferring it to the king of England, whom he ſolicited to make warre againſt Fraunce, the kingdome whereof, by the Councell of Lateran, and in an expreſſe Bull, he expoſed to him that would firſt inuade it. <hi>But amidſt ſuch and ſo great thoughts</hi> (ſaith <hi>Guicciardine) and others perhaps greater &amp; more ſecret (for nothing ſo cruell, nor ſo great beyond opinion and beleefe, which was vnfit for his terrible mind) after ſome dayes ſickneſse he was taken away by death, &amp;c.

               </p>
               <p>The Popedome of <hi>Iulius</hi> was imperious and barbarous. The Cardinals, who had felt his crueltie, before they would proceed to election, thought by preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing conditions to the future Pope, to bridle his authoritie; but preſently after (ſaith <hi>Guicciardine) they themſelues did abrogat them almoſt all,</hi>

                  </note> according as they were led, ſome with feare, and ſome with hope of fauour, all vncapable of a better State. This ſame was <hi>Iohn de Medicis,</hi> Commaunder as Legat of the Popes armie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> who had beene taken in the battell of Rauenna, and hauing made an eſcape away, contrarie to his faith, was preſently after created Generall of the warre againſt the Florentines. He was ſcarcely thirtie ſeuen yeares old, when, againſt cuſtome, by a new example, hee was aduanced to the Popedome, by the craft of the younger Cardinals.</p>
               <p>In his firſt act he made manifeſt what was to be hoped of the reformation of the Church in his time; for the pompe of his coronation was ſo exceſſiue,<note place="margin">Guicciard. l. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> as well of them of his houſe and Court, as of all the Prelats, that no man but would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, <hi>That from the inundation of the Barbarians there had beene nothing ſeene more

Neuertheleſſe the Clergie of France ſtroue againſt it, cleauing faſt to their propoſitions, eſpecially of the Pragmaticall ſanction, as appeareth by the Acts of that Councell: till that vnder king <hi>Francis</hi> his ſucceſſour, in the yeare 1516, notwithſtanding the formall Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale of the Clergie, by means of the Concordat, the Pragmatical was aboliſhed.

               </p>
               <p>Now this his prodigalitie being joyned with want, there was nothing ſo abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable which he inuented not, or hearkened not vnto, for to get in mony: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Guicciardine</hi> ſaith, <hi>He vſed verie licentiouſly the authoritie of the Apoſtolike See, when he followed the counſell of Laurence Pucci, Cardinall of the Title of foure Saints, he ſowed abroad through all the world, without any difference of times and places, moſt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Indulgences, not onely to ſuccour the liuing, but alſo to deliuer the ſoules of the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> out of the paines of Purgatorie. And becauſe it was notorious, that ſuch Indulgences were onely graunted to draw money from men, which his Commiſſaries (who had bought thoſe Commiſsions of the Popes officers) impudently demaunded, hee procured to himſelfe the euill will of men in moſt places, and cauſed many ſcandals, eſpecially in Germanie, where his ministers for a verie ſmall price ſold thoſe their wares, and in Tauernes played away at dice the power of deliuering ſoules out of Purgatorie. But that which most encreaſed their indignation, was, that Leo (who by reaſon of the facilitie of his nature, admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred his Pontificall charge with leſſe grauitie than became the Maieſtie of ſo great a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) gaue to his ſiſter Magdalene the money that came of the Indulgences in many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces in Germanie, who appoynted her Commiſſarie for that buſineſſe the Biſhop of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Arembauld, a man worthie of ſuch a Commiſsion, which hee executed with exceeding great couetouſneſse and extortion.</hi> So that the Preachers were not aſhamed, by ſuggeſtion of his miniſters, to publiſh in the pulpit, That at the ſound of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, as it was caſt into the baſon, the ſoules skipped for joy amidſt the flames, and preſently flew out of Purgatorie. Yea ſome alſo pronounced, That vpon the pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this taxation all ſinne was pardoned; not fearing to expreſſe particularly the moſt horrible, which my pen abhorreth to vtter.</p>
               <p>No more modeſtie was vſed in France, England, Poland, and other countries, where the Commiſſaries were woont to aſſure the people, That hee which gaue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ten ſoulz ſhould deliuer the ſoule for whom he gaue it out of the paines of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie; deſperatly affirming, That God, whenſoeuer they pleaſed, would preſently doe it,<note place="margin">Chriſtoph.

Moſes the Law-giuer, though a moſt meeke man, yet was moued to exceeding great anger, when he ſaw the people turned away from God, and puniſhed them ſeuerely for it. Chriſt Ieſus both God and man, the paterne of all vertues, moſt patiently ſuffered the iniuries done vnto himſelfe, but not the diſhonour done to God his Father, when he draue and whipped the ſacriligious buyers and ſellers out of the Temple.

Therfore it is a ſigne that the Biſhops of Rome haue not domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ouer all in temporal things.</hi> Item, <hi>Kings haue not their powers immediatly from the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Biſhop of Rome, neither doe they take any influence from him in temporall things, but haue their kingdomes by the conſent of the people, by ſucceſsion, by purchaſe, by donation, or by ſome other title: For earthlie power dependeth not of the ſpirituall power of the Pope, as the Captaine dependeth of his Generall, but as two powers not ſubordinat, of which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dependeth of the other: For he that poſſeſſeth a kingdome is not vaſsall of the Biſhop of Rome, neither is the Emperor his ſubiect in any manner.</hi> And theſe were the Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes of the French Church at that time.</p>
                  <p>But of the ſame time we haue two notable inſtruments, one of Germanie, the other of Fraunce: as for the firſt, <hi>Leo</hi> had ſent his Legats into Germanie to exact tenthes, vnder colour of making warre againſt the Turkes; and they had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> an eloquent Oration, to induce the Princes thereto. But they conſulting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that matter with a notable perſonage, he declared vnto them, That Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie had alreadie been ynough, and more than ynough taxed: That after peace was made among Chriſtian Princes, and that they were well diſpoſed to that holie warre, it would then be time ynough to thinke on tenthes: That ſince the time that Popes haue mixed ſacred things with prophane, or rather forſaken the ſacred to buſie themſelues onely in ciuile matters, there hath beene no meane nor end of miſeries and calamities, there hath beene no care had of the flocke of Chriſt, and contempt of diuine things hath aboundantly growne, Chriſt ſold, and the whole

                     <hi>Will you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>deſtroy the Turke?

That other, who hath elſewhere enough to do with his bordering neighbours, hath yet done vs no harme; but this man rageth euerie where, and thirſteth after the bloud of the miſerable.

It ſeemeth vnto me, when I diligently conſider the matter, that a two fold way is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> propoſed; on the one ſide, gold is demanded, which ſuperſtition commandeth; on the other ſide, if we refuſe it, the Popes excommunication is threatned. Take which way of them yee pleaſe: But O fooliſh and ſuperstitious opinion of them that beleeue, That the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, beholding all things with the eyes of iuſtice, will be led and turned at the becke and pleaſure of the Florentines, will be angrie with him that giueth not, and againe pacified with him that giueth! The excommunication of the Vicar of Chriſt is not to be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but yet not alwayes to be feared; eſpecially when it is done for humane affections. I feare the indignation of Chriſt, but of the Florentines I feare not: And now indeed is in hand the affaires of Florence, not of Chriſt. The last Summer, with great expence and charges, was warre made againſt Frauncis Duke of Vrbin, who being caſt out of his Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> but firſt appeaſed with money, Laurence de Medicis ſucceeded in his place. Iulius the ſecond being not prouident ynough, that he left no more gold; there was inuented a certaine new fraud; against all the Cardinals that were the richeſt, that they had conſpired the Popes death, and thereupon were their goods confiſcat. I ſpeake not of the Croſſes ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in euerie towne, propitious according to the meaſure of the giuers. I omit the comedie of S.

            <p>As touching therefore their ſpirituall function, the Biſhops of Rome in thoſe firſt ages, as we haue ſeene, were indifferently called <hi>Biſhops and Priests,</hi> behauing themſelues as brethren towards others, yea by their neereſt neighbours were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Brethren and Collegues;</hi> they were conſulted withall, and did themſelues alſo conſult with others about the affaires of the Church, controuerſies, ſchiſmes, and hereſies, liuing ſimply in their profeſſion, and dying vertuouſly in the confeſſion of the name of Chriſt: they glittered not in any other purple or ſcarlet than with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> their owne bloud, the Croſſe was their onely glorie. But not long after we might perceiue in ſome, that ſpirit which from Saint <hi>Paules</hi> time wrought, which vnder pretence of the dignitie of the citie, drew vnto it ſelfe the cauſe of the neighbors, would haue their counſels accounted for Decrees, and turned the honour volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily offered them into right of homage, ſeemelineſſe into ſeruitude. That ſting notwithſtanding of ambition was oftentimes beaten backe by the perſecutions, and many times alſo blunted by the vertuous Oppoſitions of the ancient Fathers. But when, after that by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> peace was reſtored to the Churches, through the fauour of Princes, they encreaſed in honors and riches, behold this ſpirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually watching ouer the worke, and not looſing any moment of time, gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> heart and ſtrength to it ſelfe by degrees. And becauſe that by reaſon of the dignitie of the citie the firſt Seat was willingly granted vnto it, they contend, That their Church ought to haue dominion ouer other Churches; That like as Rome (I meane the Commonwealth thereof) ruled ouer other cities and Prouinces, ſo the Biſhop of Rome, like as a Monarch, ouer other Biſhops; That therefore from all parts of the world they ſhould appeale vnto him; from him expect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, which all men were held abſolutely to obey: Whereas he on the contrarie ought to depend of none, might be judged of none, neither yet of all together. And hereof came thoſe falſifications that wee haue ſeene of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels and Decrees, thoſe ſuppoſitions of Acts and Hiſtories, thoſe prophanations <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of the holie Scriptures, and ſhameleſſe wreſting of them to a contrarie ſence: Hence are alſo thoſe conteſtations and proteſtations of ſome of the greateſt men in all ages, againſt that domination which they arrogat to themſelues ouer other Churches and Biſhops, which they on the other ſide, beſides and againſt all right diuine and humane, either by none, or by a falſe title, complained to be vſurped, not ſticking to pronounce, That it proceeded from none other, and pertained to none other than the forerunner of Antichriſt, or Antichriſt himſelfe. Yet thinke not for all this that they any thing ſlacked in their purpoſe. By <hi>Phocas,</hi> the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer of the Emperour <hi>Mauritius,</hi> his Lord, was the Biſhop of Rome declared Vniuerſall Biſhop: he laboured to be ſo declared, ſo farre was he off from bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> at it. Now from thenceforth, carried with full ſayles, hee maketh no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie of any thing: As Emperours and Kings in a confuſed troubled world had need of his helpe or endeuour, he got authoritie in their dominions: Hee win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Archbiſhops to his ſide, by alluring the moſt ambitious with commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and offices, and hauing woon them, hee bindeth them vnto him by a Pall; and that at firſt was ſent them freely, and onely as a token of good-will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, afterward by ordinance made neceſſarie, and a badge of ſubiection, at length by degrees it grew to be ſold, taxed, exacted, the price thereof euerie

day encreaſing, of which the Archbiſhops from time to time complayned. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that hee obtained of the Princes, That the Clergie, <hi>the Lords lot</hi> (ſayth hee) <hi>and inheritance,</hi> ſhould bee exempt and free from all temporall juriſdiction; whereupon followed licence of all vices, impunitie of all crimes, and ſo by little and little withdrew from their lawfull and naturall Lords, them whom hee had marked with his character, by voluntarie ſeruitude, yea and liege homage bound them vnto himſelfe. By their miniſterie and meanes (and not without myſterie) hee ſitteth and preſideth in the Councels of Kings, exerciſeth his kingdome in their realmes, and his tyrannie in the conſciences of kings and their people, whileſt he bindeth them to his pleaſures by his cenſures and excommunications, and as he will loſeth them from all duetie and obedience. He ſetteth Princes one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> againſt the other, or elſe bandeth their nobles and people againſt them, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth many to ſheath their ſwords in their owne bowels. By which and by ſuch like meanes hee obtained at length a Soueraigne Empire in ſpirituall things throughout the Weſt. And becauſe the Eaſt yeelded not vnto him, hee excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated thoſe Churches, and chuſeth to himſelfe from among his owne, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarches of the Eaſterne Churches; imaginarie indeed, but yet future Images of his vniuerſall Monarchie which hee arrogateth to himſelfe: who were reſident with him, repreſenting the perſon, or vizor rather, of the Orientall Church. Yea when hee celebrated the Maſſe,<note place="margin">Cerem. Roman. l. <hi>3.</hi> Charta <hi>6.</hi> &amp; <hi>7.</hi>
               </note> hee commaunded the Epiſtle and Goſpell to bee read in Latine and in Greeke, ſignifying both Churches; but in Latine firſt,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and with ſeuen candles lighted, in Greeke afterward with two onely lighted, for to ſhew the ſupereminencie of the Latine Church: Yet who knoweth not that the Greeke Teſtament is the originall, and the Latine but a tranſlation taken out of the Greeke? At laſt hee pardoneth all ſinnes out of his fulneſſe of power: thereby affecting the Maieſtie of God, who alone pardoneth, and of Chriſt the Lambe of God, who alone taketh away ſinnes. Yet truely hee giueth not thoſe pardons, but ſelleth and maketh merchandiſe of them, and vnder that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text waſteth and deſpoyleth the whole world. Then hee inſtituted Iubilies at certaine ſet times, which by degrees hee ſhortened, being truely his generall Marts and Faires, in which he proſtituteth, ſetteth to ſale, and vttereth his Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> At his will and pleaſure moreouer, hee openeth heauen, curſeth the earth, quencheth Purgatorie, ſhutteth hell: as if he were God he maketh Saints, bindeth diuels, commaundeth Angels, maketh himſelfe Preſident in generall Councells, Head of the Catholike Church, yea Spouſe thereof; which Titles are due vnto none but to Ieſus Chriſt alone, incommunicable to any creature: God on earth, made out of earth, commaunding in heauen; he ordaineth a god to be worſhipped on earth, which he will haue to be beleeued, and doth beleeue to be God, whom he cauſeth to be carried about on horſebacke before him, for to get to himſelfe the greater reuerence, euen for the moſt part among his vileſt carriage, among ſcullions and lackeys.

            <p>Now of the temporall. Wee found the Biſhops of Rome vnder perſecution had learned by the Teſtament of our Sauiour, not to affect worldlie power, but to be readie contrariwiſe to ſuffer cruelties from earthlie Princes: By the Epiſtles of S. <hi>Paule</hi> and S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and alſo by their examples, to honor the kings and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the world, to obey the froward and thoſe that were hard to be pleaſed; not to rule as Lords, <hi>ne quidem in Domini cleros,</hi> from whence came the name of Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie. And ſurely till the time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and ſome time after, they had not any temporall juriſdiction: yea and after that by the gifts of Chriſtian Princes they were enriched, for many ages they ſpake and liued ſubmiſſiuely after the manner <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of vaſſals, and ſeruants, and as other ſubjects; ſuffered both generall and prouinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Councels to be called and aſſembled, without contradiction, by Chriſtian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours and Princes, and ſubmitted themſelues vnto them and their ordinances, and at their commaundements came and went, without complaining, without ſo much as muttering of theſe their documents or pretenſions. But if it were a thing ſo important to the honour of Chriſt, and the ſafetie of the Church, as they would make men beleeue, that this Vicar of Chriſt ſhould be acknowledged through all the world, girded and armed with two ſwords; where was now their zeale, that they ſuffered with ſuch negligence their rights of ſo great moment to periſh, to

But the Roman Empire now falling to ruine, by reaſon both of the inward diſeaſes of the ſame, and the ſundrie irrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Northerne people; the Biſhops of Rome began to build on thoſe ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines, and to abuſe the abſence and weakeneſſe of the Emperours, whom they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled out of Italie by the armes of the Lombards, and confined them to Greece; and vnder colour that they would not admit Images into their Temples, cut them off from the Church, abſolued their ſubjects from their oaths of fidelitie, and withdrawing them from obedience to their Princes, bound them at laſt to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. In Italie, the Lombards waxing too ſtrong, they ſupplanted them by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Frenchmen; and after that, the Frenchmen by the Germans; oppoſing euer them that were fartheſt off againſt them that were nearer: and ſo ſoon as any had gotten credit and authoritie with the people, they caſt him out by intruding ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which could not but neceſſarily depend on their fauour. And when the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans went about to ſettle and eſtabliſh their Empire in Italie, they ſtirred vp fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions againſt them in Germanie, and cauſed the ſonnes by breaking the bond of duetie, both diuine and humane, naturall and ciuile, to riſe vp againſt their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And theſe things euer vnder pretence of hereſie. For, to permit them not the abſolute power to diſpoſe of all Biſhopricks, or diligently to watch ouer their diſcipline, or to maintain the elections according to the antient canons, or to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> their continuall exactions and rapines, or but endeauor to do it, was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with them horrible hereſie, Simonie.
